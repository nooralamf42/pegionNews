      "content": "PATHANAMTHITTA: Causing concern to Sabarimala pilgrims, the government has decided that only darshans booked online will be happening for this year's Mandala-Makaravilakku season. Spot booking will be stopped completely. With this, it is feared that the devotees who reach Nilakkal and Pamba directly without booking will have to return without getting darshan. The decision was taken at the Sabarimala review meeting chaired by the Chief Minister. This is to avoid protests and clashes when the rush increases. However, the protests are likely to intensify when there is no spot booking and devotees are stopped. Thousands of pilgrims, including those from other states, reach Pamba directly without booking. It is not clear whether they will be allowed to climb Sabarimala. In previous years, there was spot booking in Pandalam, Chengannur, Nilakkal and Pampa. During the end days of the pilgrimage, spot bookings were restricted to Nilakkal and Pampa only. According to unofficial estimates, more than 5,000 devotees visited the temple every day on the busy days last time. The groups that walk from Erumeli through the inland forest via the traditional route also do not book online. That is because they can't meet the stipulated time. More than 20,000 people who came last time like this had climbed the hill by making spot bookings at Pamba. 80,000 people a day Concerns The decision to permit darshan only for those who book online should be reconsidered. Proposals to facilitate the pilgrimage, including this, will be submitted to the chief minister on the 9th. Akkeraman Kalidasan Bhattathiripad, Ayyappa Seva Samajam State President The new arrangement is to have an understanding of those coming for the pilgrimage. If complaints are received, the Devaswom Board will consider it sympathetically and bring them to the notice of the government. Adv. A. Ajikumar, Devaswom Board Member Pilgrims last time(devaswom board's estimate): 50 lakh Last year's revenue: Rs 357.47 crore",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Thousands of protesters gathered outside the headquarters of Hungary’s public media corporation on Saturday to demonstrate against what they say is an entrenched propaganda network operated by the nationalist government at taxpayer expense. The protest was organized by Hungary’s most prominent opposition figure, Péter Magyar, and his upstart TISZA party, which has emerged in recent months as the most serious political challenge for Prime Minister Viktor Orbán since he took power nearly 15 years ago. Magyar, whose party received nearly 30% of the vote in European Union elections this summer and is polling within a few points of the governing Fidesz party, has been outspoken about what he sees as the damage Orbán’s “propaganda factory” has done to Hungary’s democracy. “What is happening here in Hungary in 2024, and calling itself ‘public service’ media, is a global scandal,” Magyar told the crowd in Budapest on Saturday. “Enough of the nastiness, enough of the lies, enough of the propaganda. Our patience has run out. The time for confrontation has come.” Both Hungarian and international observers have long warned that press freedom in the Central European country was under threat, and that Orbán’s party has used media buyouts by government-connected business tycoons to build a pro-government media empire. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders estimates that such buyouts have given Orbán’s party control of some 80% of Hungary’s media market resources. In 2021, the group put Orbán on its list of media “predators,” the first EU leader to earn the distinction. On Saturday, Balázs Tömpe, a protester that traveled several hours to attend the demonstration, called the state media headquarters a “factory of lies.” “The propaganda goes out at such a level and is so unbalanced that it’s blood boiling, and I think we need to raise our voices,” he said. “It’s nonsense that only government propaganda comes out in the media that is financed by the taxpayers.” A retired teacher from southern Hungary, Ágnes Gera, said dissenting voices were censored from the public media, limiting Hungarians’ access to information about political alternatives. “It’s very burdensome and unfortunate that the system works this way where the public only hears from one side and don’t even know about the other side,” she said. Magyar demanded the resignation of the public media director, and echoed complaints from many opposition politicians that they are not provided the opportunity to appear on public television to communicate with voters. He called his supporters to another demonstration on Oct 23, a national holiday commemorating Hungary’s failed revolution against Soviet domination in 1956. Advertisement",

      "content": "For more financial news, go to the News24 Business front page. Kimberley Dube takes great care with her appearance. She always looks sharp and fashionable in smart-looking jeans, t-shirts, sweatpants, tops, and designer sneakers. \"I love jeans – can't get enough of them,\" the 35-year-old says. But while she may give the appearance of someone with money to spend on expensive apparel, the self-employed entrepreneur laughs when she says, \"You are wrong! These clothes are inexpensive; I get them from secondhand clothes sellers.\" Dube, who lives in Harare, is just one of a multitude of Zimbabweans who have turned their backs on home-grown fashion brands, opting for the booming market in secondhand – or \"pre-loved\" – imports from overseas instead. \"There's no shop in this country where you can pay as little as $2 (R35) for a pair of jeans,\" she scoffs. Dube is particularly drawn to the stylish individuality that buying second-hand clothes affords her. \"Most clothing stores carry mass-produced items, which you'll see all over town; the stuff here is unique.\" \"Here\" is a small market next door to a suburban shopping centre in a middle-class neighbourhood, where we are perusing the wares. Dube's equally trendy friend and fellow millennial, Gamuchirai Mpofu, a huge fan of preloved clothes, has also come along. \"The nice thing about shopping here is that though the clothes are used, they are durable, unlike the Chinese stuff sold in most shops,\" she says. Both of them say buying used clothes gives them access to a variety of brands and items they can't find in Zimbabwean shops. \"It's about uniqueness and individuality,\" Mpofu says. Aljazeera Winnie Mutsokoti, an effervescent seller at the market, welcomes us with a warm smile. She has four frame tents, each laid out like a section in a clothing store. We head straight to the one in which various styles and sizes of denim wear are neatly displayed on hangers. Some of the merchandise on offer here appears new or... fin24",

      "content": "WITH THE HELP of Michael Obafemi, Plymouth Argyle’s improved form continued with a 2-1 win at home over Blackburn Rovers. Wayne Rooney’s side now sit at 14th in the table, and this latest victory over 8th-placed Rovers will do a world of good for their confidence. Obafemi opened the scoring after 15 minutes, turning in a cross from inside the penalty area. The travelling fans from Lancashire might have felt they had earned a share of the points when Joe Rankin-Costello equalled with four minutes left on the clock, but Morgan Whittaker popped up in the seventh minute of time added on to secure the victory for a delirious Home Park. On-loan Mark O’Mahony netted for struggling Portsmouth to give them a glimpse of three points today, but they had to settle with a draw against 10th-placed Oxford United. O’Mahony, getting some regular football while away from parent club Brighton and Hove Albion, got across his marker to cushion a header to the net in the 58th minute. It didn’t last long though and Louie Sibley equalised on 72 minutes to leave Pompey second from bottom with their form only marginally improving. Elsewhere, James McClean is helping the push for promotion with Wrexham in EFL League One. He scored one and provided an assist in their 4-1 win over Northampton Town. In the Women’s Super League, Brighton and Hove Albion beat Aston Villa 4-2. Ireland’s Anna Patten played the full game for Villa and won a penalty.",

Michelle told Closer Magazine : 'I am happy to have a night on the sofa with our dogs watching TV and relaxing, but we do still like getting dressed up and go out for dinner. 'In the old days we'd go out for dinner and drinks until the early hours. But now after dinner, I'll look at my watch and say, 'Its 9.30pm, we'd better get back home for bedtime' It's a bit more boring now.'

In an interview with The Observer last year, Michelle said: 'I was filming in Australia and hadn't seen the house for months. And when I walked in, Mark had lit all the candles and... I couldn't speak for five minutes. 'He was like, 'What do you think?' I couldn't find the words to say how I felt, because I was so overwhelmed. I just burst out crying. It still gets me emotional. Because we've worked really hard for it. We've had to make a lot of sacrifices.'

      "description": "Maureen and Graham Green 'dedicate their whole life to gardening'",
      "content": "A green-fingered couple have once again been awarded the coveted title of best residential garden in Newcastle. The aptly-named Maureen and Graham Green have earned the accolade for the fourth year in a row thanks to their 'stimulating' and 'educational' space in Kidsgrove , which reuses rainwater and encourages wildlife at every turn. The nature lovers' colourful garden, which includes a new recycled boat feature and equipment to observe the different species that visit it, secured them the council’s top prize at the annual Newcastle in Bloom awards. This year's awards were sponsored by Black Star Ceramics, Garners Garden Centre, Jacksons Nurseries, Tea Room and Farm Shop, and Morrisons in Newcastle. Accepting his mum and dad’s award on their behalf, son Danny said: \"My mum and dad will be really happy to win this award after all of their hard work. They dedicate their whole life to gardening as it brings them so much joy – spending hours in their garden every day all year round – so it’s really nice recognition. \"My parents are always thinking of something new and different to do; this year they have salvaged a large boat, which was destined for landfill, and also an old lobster basket – which is used as a prop for flowers and plants – to create a seaside theme. They also grow their own plants from cuttings and seeds. \"They even have a house rainwater recycling system where they pump filtered rainwater to different areas of their large garden using a 1,000 litre tank!\" Here is a round-up of the other award winners: Hanging baskets category Seasoned competitors Graham and Vera Tagg, from Porthill, emerged victorious in the popular hanging baskets category thanks to their \"vibrant and productive haven\" which provides a “riot of colour and enjoyment”. Most environmentally-friendly garden Newcomer Robert Dutton received the accolade for most environmentally-friendly garden for creating a unique area – using minimal space and expenditure with most plants being propagated from seed, cuttings or division – while showing his dedication to recycling everything possible. Community gardens and special feature awards It was a double whammy for Kidsgrove Care Solutions who won both the community gardens section and the special feature award in memory of keen horticulturist Alfred Birch. Enthusiastic volunteers have transformed a neglected area at Chesterton Park into a thriving hub featuring an excellent allotment and vibrant planting. The competition themes are weaved throughout their project in an innovative way. Standout sights include 'beautiful' and 'creative' petrol and electric car features which demonstrate how changing to a more sustainable fuel would create a greener future for us all. Outstanding achievement award Stock by Feasted, a vibrant bar and restaurant in Newcastle town centre, celebrated winning the outstanding achievement award in memory of Ros Bason. Judges praised owner Cris Cohen’s 'plant to plate' policy which involves growing a variety of produce in their amazing kitchen garden - a nearby raised bed which has been transformed with help from local college students. Allotments category In the popular allotments category, Graham and Christine Hyatt – who tend to a 'pristine and inspired plot' at The Acre in Silverdale – were the overall winners for showing 'exceptional creativity' with their hand-carved signage, wildlife theme and high quality produce. Best vegetable plot The 'best vegetable plot' award goes to Steve and Chanikarm Bowler thanks to their impressive, Asian-inspired plot at Crown Bank in Talke which boasts oriental sweet potatoes, beans, chillies and aubergines. Licensed premises/businesses section Care home Samuel Hobson House, in Wolstanton, came out on top in the licensed premises/businesses section in recognition of a beautiful garden featuring a colourful array of annuals and perennials. Schools category Continual hard work and the layout of the site – with a strong focus on sustainable planting – resulted in Keele University Day Nursery achieving top marks in the schools category. Best eco school After returning to the competition last year following building work, the Coppice Academy in Newcastle has been named 'best eco school' for their tree planting, wildflower meadow, wildlife habitats, new pond area and enthusiastic pupils who take great pride in their environment. 'Judges were excited to visit all the amazing projects' Councillor Craig Skelding, cabinet member for leisure, culture and heritage, said: \"Our annual awards ceremony at the New Vic continues to be one of the main highlights in the bloom calendar. It’s an event we all look forward to as it’s a great way to thank everyone for their efforts and round off the year. \"This time, we are also celebrating our supporting role in helping Newcastle BID to win two major awards in Heart of England in Bloom as well as being selected to represent the region in next year’s national Britain in Bloom competition. The council’s gardening competitions play an important part in the borough’s entry by bringing communities together, through their shared love of horticulture, to help make Newcastle-under-Lyme an even nicer place to live, work and visit. \"Everyone involved continues to do their bit to improve the quality of life in their area and the competitions give people a real focus, something that many have come to rely on in the last few years. The judges were excited to visit all the amazing projects and it was great to see the important theme of environmental sustainability coming through the entries in many different ways. \"Well done to all the nominees and winners: the standard was extremely high once again. Special congratulations go to Maureen and Graham who manage to come up with something different, and equally fantastic, every single year. Their garden is highly wildlife sympathetic with so many examples. Wildlife can be observed using binoculars, photography and a simple laboratory procedure which enable you to examine things like seeds and owl pellets in minute detail.\" If you're on the lookout for local news, we have you covered with our FREE email newsletter - sign up in the box at the top of this story or click here .",

      "content": "The State of Texas on Thursday social media platform TikTok for violating a Texas law enacted to protect children’s online privacy. The lawsuit alleged that TikTok breached provisions of the (SCOPE) Act, which came into effect on September 1, 2024, and places obligations on digital service providers to provide parental control tools and privacy protections. The state put forward three alleged violations under SCOPE. The first relates to Section 509.101 of the law, which requires TikTok to provide commercially reasonable tools in its app to allow guardians and parents to verify their identity and relationship with a minor. The second alleged violation falls under Section 509.052, which prohibits digital service providers from sharing, disclosing, and selling minors’ personal identifying information to third parties without permission from the verified parent. Finally, the state argued TikTok has violated Section 509.054, which requires digital service providers to provide parental supervision tools that would allow a parent to control privacy and account settings, including disclosure of a minor’s personal information to third parties. The lawsuit asserted that TikTok has violated these sections of the SCOPE Act by not providing guardian verification or parental control tools and selling or disclosing minors’ personal information to third parties such as business partners and search engines without consent. Texas is seeking $10,000 per violation. In a announcing the lawsuit, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stated: I will continue to hold TikTok and other Big Tech companies accountable for exploiting Texas children and failing to prioritize minors’ online safety and privacy. Texas law requires social media companies to take steps to protect kids online and requires them to provide parents with tools to do the same. TikTok and other social media companies cannot ignore their duties under Texas law. TikTok in the US has recently faced significant legal scrutiny. In April, the platform became subject to a bill that requires its parent company, ByteDance, to find a new owner for TikTok by the end of 2024. Additionally, other US states such as Montana have against TikTok, attempting to ban the app entirely in their state. In response, TikTok issued a against the US government, asserting its free speech rights. That challenge will be decided by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Justice Louis Brandeis died On October 5, 1941, US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis died at the age of 84.Brandeis had become the first Jewish justice on the United States Supreme Court in 1916 after a hotly-contested nomination battle.

      "content": "BEIJING: The European Union (EU) voted on Friday to impose tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports of battery electric vehicles (EVs) manufactured in China, a move that has ignited significant opposition from various EU member states and the automotive industry. In response, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade expressed its firm opposition on Saturday, adding that China and the EU should resolve their differences through dialogue in order to reach a solution that aligns with the interests of both parties. China’s Ministry of Commerce on Friday also expressed strong opposition to the EU’s decision, considering it “unfair, non-compliant and unreasonable,” while acknowledging the EU’s political willingness to continue negotiations. Technical teams from China and the EU will resume talks on October 7. A divided bloc The European Commission stated that the proposal had received the necessary support from EU member states for adoption. The vote revealed a divided bloc: 10 members backed the tariffs, 12 abstained, and five – including Germany, the EU’s largest economy and a key automotive producer – voted against them. “Despite the vote for potential punitive tariffs against China, Ursula von der Leyen’s EU Commission should not trigger a trade war. We need a negotiated solution,” Germany’s Finance Minister Christian Lindner wrote on social media platform X on Friday. A day earlier, the minister also warned on the platform that tariffs on Chinese EVs “would be wrong,” he said. “We have to speak plainly and negotiate with China – but trade wars only have losers.” His remarks were echoed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who said in an interview with state radio on Friday, “What they are making us do right now, or what the EU wants to do, is an economic Cold War.” Prior to the vote, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated on Thursday that the country is “strongly against” the proposal, saying it is “so harmful and dangerous” and that the Brussels bureaucrats are jeopardizing the future competitiveness of the European economy. Finland, which abstained from the vote, thought there was not enough proof of damage caused to the EU by the so-called Chinese state support to the EV industry, Xinhua reported. Criticism from the industry The announcement has also triggered an outcry from the automotive industry, which thought it was a mistake and urged for further negotiations. Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in a statement issued on Friday that Germany’s veto is the “right signal” from the government, which has backed the interests of the European and German automotive industry and its employees with a view to the economy, prosperity and growth. Mueller said the EU decision is “a further step away from global cooperation” and called for negotiations between the EU and China, saying they “must prevent an escalation – ideally avert the tariffs so that we don’t risk a trade conflict.” German automaker Mercedes-Benz said the tariffs are “a mistake that can lead to far-reaching negative consequences.” Its CEO, Ola Kallenius, said at the Berlin Global Dialogue on Wednesday that direct tariffs are “a very crude instrument,” advocating for better solutions that would not hinder access to crucial markets. Volkswagen said the tariffs are “the wrong approach” and called for the two sides to “constructively continue” the negotiations. BMW CEO Oliver Zipse called the vote “a fatal signal” for the European auto industry. He urged for a quick settlement between the European Commission and China to “prevent a trade conflict from which no one gains.” Geely Holding, which owns Sweden’s Volvo, expressed its “great disappointment” in the decision, saying it may potentially hinder EU-China economic and trade relations and ultimately harm European companies and consumer interests. Consumers affected Concerns extend beyond the industry to consumers. According to a study released by the Kiel-based economic research institute Kiel Institute for the World Economy in May, once the EU imposes tariffs on China-made EVs, the price of EVs in Europe will be significantly affected, resulting in a significant increase in the cost for local consumers. The institute projected that a 20 percent tariff could lead to a 25 percent drop in imports of Chinese EVs. “Converted to the almost 500,000 vehicles imported in 2023, this corresponds to an estimated 125,000 units worth almost $4 billion,” said the simulations. “The decline would largely be offset by an increase in production within the EU and a lower volume of EV exports, which would likely mean noticeably higher prices for end consumers,” said the institute. Mueller also emphasized that the proposed tariffs “would not only further increase the risk of a mutual trade conflict but would also make vehicles considerably more expensive for consumers.” She noted that the potential damage caused by countervailing duties outweighs the potential benefits of this instrument.

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Thousands of protesters gathered outside the headquarters of Hungary’s public media corporation on Saturday to demonstrate against what they say is an entrenched propaganda network operated by the nationalist government at taxpayer expense. The protest was organized by Hungary’s most prominent opposition figure, Péter Magyar, and his upstart TISZA party, which has emerged in recent months as the most serious political challenge for Prime Minister Viktor Orbán since he took power nearly 15 years ago. Magyar, whose party received nearly 30% of the vote in European Union elections this summer and is polling within a few points of the governing Fidesz party, has been outspoken about what he sees as the damage Orbán’s “propaganda factory” has done to Hungary’s democracy. “What is happening here in Hungary in 2024, and calling itself ‘public service’ media, is a global scandal,” Magyar told the crowd in Budapest on Saturday. “Enough of the nastiness, enough of the lies, enough of the propaganda. Our patience has run out. The time for confrontation has come.” Both Hungarian and international observers have long warned that press freedom in the Central European country was under threat, and that Orbán’s party has used media buyouts by government-connected business tycoons to build a pro-government media empire. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders estimates that such buyouts have given Orbán’s party control of some 80% of Hungary’s media market resources. In 2021, the group put Orbán on its list of media “predators,” the first EU leader to earn the distinction. On Saturday, Balázs Tömpe, a protester that traveled several hours to attend the demonstration, called the state media headquarters a “factory of lies.” “The propaganda goes out at such a level and is so unbalanced that it’s blood boiling, and I think we need to raise our voices,” he said. “It’s nonsense that only government propaganda comes out in the media that is financed by the taxpayers.” A retired teacher from southern Hungary, Ágnes Gera, said dissenting voices were censored from the public media, limiting Hungarians’ access to information about political alternatives. “It’s very burdensome and unfortunate that the system works this way where the public only hears from one side and don’t even know about the other side,” she said. Magyar demanded the resignation of the public media director, and echoed complaints from many opposition politicians that they are not provided the opportunity to appear on public television to communicate with voters. He called his supporters to another demonstration on Oct 23, a national holiday commemorating Hungary’s failed revolution against Soviet domination in 1956. Advertisement",

October Prime Day FAQs Per Amazon, Prime Big Deal Days (more commonly referred to as \"October Prime Day\" or \"Prime Day 2\") is a holiday kickoff event designed to offer Prime members exclusive access to early holiday deals across popular categories and top brands. Amazon's Prime Day sales occur twice yearly, once in July and once in October, with several smaller sale events, like Amazon's Big Spring Sale, popping up on the calendar throughout the year. Amazon announced in September that the 2024 dates for October Prime Day are October 8 and October 9. Last year, the October Prime Big Deal Days sale occurred on October 10 and October 11. October's Prime Big Deal Days is a two-day sale event that mimics the format of July Prime Day. Customers should expect deals to expire as early as 11:59 p.m. PDT on the second day of the sale, though it's normal for some deals to hang around for hours or often days after. Although there's no way of knowing which discounts will stay or go when the clock strikes midnight, we'll continually update ZDNET.com with the best deals that are still live even after the sale ends, so be sure to check back. As a ZDNET editor, I only write about deals myself or a team member would want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. I looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. I also examined customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals I recommend. These recommendations may also be based on my own testing (or testing by another ZDNET expert) -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter. As the name implies, only Prime members in participating countries can shop the October Prime Big Deal Days event. If you don't have a membership, you'll need to enroll prior to the shopping event's kickoff to access exclusive deals and offers. Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month, or you can purchase an annual membership for $139, saving you a few dollars. Also: These 5 new Amazon features make finding the products you need even easier All college students and those aged 18 to 24 are eligible for a discount and can pay $7.49 per month or $69 per year. In addition, those with qualified government assistance (which may include select seniors) can receive a Prime membership for just $6.99 after their free trial. ZDNET's experts are searching through Prime Day sales to find the best discounts by category.

Get the latest Scottish crime and courts news sent straight to your inbox with our daily Criminal Record newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest Scottish crime and courts news sent straight to your inbox with our daily Criminal Record newsletter We have more newsletters \"The clock is running\" to prosecute Nicola Sturgeon's husband in connection with the alleged embezzlement of SNP party funds, a defence advocate has said. Peter Murrell, 59, was charged in April by police as part of Operation Branchform, a long-running investigation into SNP finances, but prosecutors from the Crown Office have yet to issue information over further action. In Scotland, a police charge is a preliminary step before prosecutors decide whether to take the case to court. Murrell, who was chief executive of the SNP for 23 years, married former first minister Ms Sturgeon in 2010 and has been arrested twice during the SNP finance investigation. The couple share a home in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, which was searched by police and forensics officers. Ms Sturgeon was also questioned in June 2023, but was not charged. Sottish criminal defence lawyer Thomas Leonard Ross KC told Sky News the probe \"cannot go on indefinitely\". He said: \"Once somebody is charged then they have the right to a trial within a reasonable time. \"Before a person is formally charged, there might be an argument as to whether the clock is efficiently running. \"There is absolutely no doubt that it is running in relation to Mr Murrell, so certainly the police and Crown Office have to be alive to that. \"The police inquiry cannot go on indefinitely.\" Nationalist campaigner Sean Clerkin triggered the investigation in 2021 after raising concerns about more than £600,000 raised for a second referendum. Mr Clerkin told Sky News he had received death threats, and urged that the probe be finished before the Scottish Parliament elections in 2026. He said: \"All these years down the line I have been persecuted by nationalists on social media and at rallies, threatening to do me in, threatened to take me out. I have had death threats. \"This case has to be wound up by the end of this year. In terms of the investigation, for us to have free and fair elections in 2026 without this hanging over any of the pro-independence parties.\" An SNP spokesman said: \"While the police investigation has reportedly been completed and passed over to the Crown Office, the case remains active and it would be inappropriate to comment.\" A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: \"A standard prosecution report has been received by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service from Police Scotland in relation to a 59-year-old man and incidents said to have occurred between 2016 and 2023. \"Connected investigations of two other individuals, a man aged 72 and a 53-year-old woman, remain ongoing. \"Professional prosecutors from COPFS and independent counsel will review this report. They will make decisions on the next steps without involving the Lord Advocate or Solicitor General. All Scotland's prosecutors operate independently of political influence. \"Before deciding what action to take, if any, in the public interest, prosecutors will consider if there is enough evidence. There must be evidence from at least two separate sources to establish that a crime was committed and that the person under investigation was the perpetrator.

      "content": "Gujarat's Vaidehi Chaudhari with the women's singles winner's trophy at the Fenesta Open National tennis championship in New Delhi on Saturday. All the buzz through the week had been around her 15-year-old rival, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , but it made little difference to Vaidehi Chaudhari . The 24-year-old from Gujarat, who hadn’t dropped a set the whole week, maintained the clean slate by taming Maaya 6-3, 6-3 to reclaim the women’s singles title at the Fenesta Open National tennis championship in New Delhi on Saturday. “It was a really good match. I was playing a young girl. I had pressure as I was the top seed here, and had won the title before also. She (Maaya) had nothing to lose,” said Vaidehi, referring to her success in the tournament in 2022. She had also been runner-up to Shrivalli Rashmikaa last year, making it “three finals in a row”. Tamil Nadu’s 17-year-old Rethin Pranav claimed the men’s singles title, overcoming Nitin Kumar Sinha of Railways 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 for his maiden championship. Maharashtra’s Prisha Shinde clinched the Under-18 girls’ trophy, fighting back from 2-5 in the second set to beat Tamil Nadu’s Diya Ramesh 1-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in a two-hour long final. Aradhya Kshitij of Karnataka lifted the boys’ title with a 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 win over Manipur’s second seed Shanker Heisnam. The women’s final lasted an hour and 35 minutes, but it could have been even shorter. Vaidehi was up 5-0 in the second set when Maaya fought back to make it 3-5 before the Indian Billie Jean King Cup player nipped the late challenge from her rival. “I started cramping at 5-0. I was sick, was having cold and fever the last three days,” revealed Vaidehi. The title caps a fine run in the past few months for Vaidehi, starting with the $25,000 title in Chinese Taipei in June and followed by a semifinal in Kazakhstan and another final and a semifinal in Thailand. Despite the progress on court, it has been a struggle for Vaidehi to improve her tennis finances. “I was travelling alone in Taipei, and it was really hot out there. I played really well, I beat two players ranked higher than me. I was down 0-6, 0-3 in the second round, but came back strongly. In the final, I was again first set down. It’s the biggest title of my career so far,” she said. “The challenge for me is, being a woman, I cannot travel alone to some places (tournament venues) because they are not safe. If I take sponsorship, then I can have someone to travel with me,” said Vaidehi, who has her own travelling expenses covered by the Gujarat State sports authority. Yet, now that her goal for the year of winning a $25K title is achieved, Vaidehi is looking ahead with positivity. “I have slowly taken one step at a time. Now I am just more confident,” said Vaidehi, who will be travelling to Australia after a 10-day break. “There are a series of five big tournaments. I am looking forward to playing my first $75K event.”",

      "content": "Changes to Social Security are coming and The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has proposed raising the retirement age to 70 as a way to improve the program. Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow at the Roe Institute , advocated for this change in an article for the foundation, suggesting that raising the eligibility age for Social Security benefits could help address the imminent funding crisis facing the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA’s 2023 Trustees Report, published earlier this year, warned that the trust funds supporting the largest U.S. benefits program—covering retirees, survivors, and disabled individuals—are set to run out by 2035 unless Congress acts to maintain their solvency. In her article, Greszler suggested gradually raising the normal retirement age from 67 to 69 or 70, with an incremental increase of one or two months each year, tying future changes to life expectancy. According to Greszler, “increased life expectancies, improved healthcare, and the shift away from physically demanding work” imply that many older Americans are now more capable of staying in the workforce longer than before. This, she argued, could help address the looming funding gap in Social Security. She also pointed out that keeping older workers employed could offer advantages beyond merely stabilizing Social Security’s finances. “The benefits of older workers staying in the workforce expand beyond Social Security’s solvency , and the additional income that Americans would earn. Older workers’ wisdom and experience provides an invaluable insight and mentorship to younger workers. And today’s labor market affords increasing opportunities for older workers to gradually ease into retirement, instead of abruptly exiting their careers.” Greszler acknowledged that raising the retirement age alone would not entirely solve the impending financial problems of the Social Security system . Instead, she suggested it could address only about 20 to 30 percent of the shortfall projected by 2035. “While updating Social Security’s retirement age is an important component of reform, it would only solve about 20 percent to 30 percent of the program’s shortfalls. A more accurate inflation adjustment would solve another 20 percent to 25 percent of the program’s shortfalls.” Other experts’ take on the Social Security funding crisis Other experts in Social Security and financial policy do not necessarily agree with the proposal. Stephen Kates, a principal financial analyst with RetireGuide.com , described raising the age of eligibility as “a backwards way of simplifying reducing benefits.” Although not directly commenting on Greszler’s article, Kates pointed out that raising either the earliest eligibility age of 62 or the full retirement age of 67 would mean smaller and delayed benefits for future retirees. He explained that currently, beneficiaries who start taking Social Security at 62 generally see a 30 percent reduction in their monthly payments compared to waiting until the full retirement age of 67 (for those born after 1959). The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) has previously stated that raising the retirement age for Social Security would effectively reduce benefits by an amount similar to the projected benefit cuts expected in the 2030s if no legislative action is taken to secure funding. Zachary Pleat, a senior researcher at Media Matters , also expressed concern over the Heritage Foundation’s proposal. He tied this policy recommendation to a broader political agenda, referencing Project 2025 , an initiative led by the Heritage Foundation, which aims to prepare a conservative coalition for a future administration starting in January 2025. “ The Heritage Foundation , which has played a central role in organizing the planned extremist takeover of the federal government known as Project 2025 for the next Republican president, is now calling for the Social Security retirement age to be raised to 70,” Pleat said. Project 2025 , according to its description, involves a coalition of conservative organizations seeking to ensure that a new conservative administration is ready to govern effectively starting in January 2025. This proposal to raise the Social Security retirement age is viewed by critics as part of a broader ideological push to restructure key government functions and benefits.",

      "content": "Minister for agriculture and marketing Tummala Nageshwara Rao on Saturday emphasised that proper sanitation and cleanliness are essential for the development of any town or city. While laying the foundation stone for a stormwater drain and CC roads in the 58th division of Khammam town, a project valued at Rs 10 lakh, he stated that better management of sanitation and cleanliness would enhance the reputation of any town or city. Therefore, prioritising cleanliness is crucial, as it directly impacts public health in the city. He urged owners of open plots to level their land to prevent rainwater stagnation and instructed municipal corporation officials to ensure that household waste is not disposed of in open plots by residents. He also advised owners to erect fencing around their open plots in residential areas and called for quality assurance in the development of CC roads and drainage systems.

      "content": "The Noon Optimist Club of Marshall met Wednesday, Oct. 2 in Hutchins Hall of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. We enjoyed a taco bar from Jucy’s. Our thanks to Optimists Le Ila and Charles Dixon for picking up the food and to Le Ila for providing pumpkin spice cakes for dessert (one a bundt ring and the other in the shape of a pumpkin with vines and leaves made of fondant! President Julie Brock called on Optimist Le Ila for the opening prayer and then led in the pledge to the flag and Optimist Creed. President Julie then welcomed the Young Texans, their families and Marshall High School school administrators, Principal Mike Miller and Associate Principal Carolyn Oliver. She explained that all the 2024-25 Young Texans had a chance at receiving one of the $500 grants awarded at random to three of the Texannes and three of the Texans at the end of year awards assembly. Optimist Julie then introduced Jiya Mistry as the Young Texanne for October. Her favorite classes are focused on healthcare. “I love science classes and any healthcare career and technical education classes — med. micro, certified clinical medical assistant.” Her favorite teachers are Erica Wilson for English language arts, Anna Day for health science, Jana Duck for algebra II and Skylyn Potts for biology. Her grade point average is 5.489. Jiya is active in extra-curricular activities such as Student Council, National Honor Society (where she serves as secretary), the senior class (where she serves as vice president), and the Interact Club (where she serves as historian). She has been on the varsity volleyball team for four years and “so far for three years” has participated in powerlifting (her top lift weight is 300 pounds!). In the area of religion, she said, “I am Hindu, so I do believe in numerous religious activities such as Garba, Diwali and many more.” Optimist Richard Magrill said that he was familiar with Diwali, a time for religious rituals and sharing traditional stories and also an opportunity to spruce up the home, buy new clothes, and, of course, enjoy parties, feasting and an exchange of gifts. (For Hindus, Diwali is linked to the ancient legend of Lord Rama, who was deprived of his kingdom and sent into exile for 14 years. It celebrates Rama’s eventual defeat of the evil spirit Ravana, and his triumphant return to his home.) However, he asked about Garba? As it turns out Garba is a nine-day festival that is not easy to give a short answer to! It is a dance that honors, worships and celebrates the feminine form of divinity. “Each day a different goddess is emphasized,” explained Shilpa Mistry. Intrigued, Optimist Richard went to Wikipedia for a little more information. “Traditionally, the dance is performed by women in a circle around a clay lantern with a light inside. The vessel itself is a symbol of the body, within whom divinity (in the form of the Goddess or Devi) resides. Garba is danced around this symbol to honor the fact that all humans have the divine energy of Devi within them. “Garba is performed in a circle (concentric circles when there are many people). The circle represents the Hindu view of time. In Hinduism, time is cyclical. As the cycle of time revolves, from birth to life to death to rebirth, the only thing that is constant is the Goddess, an unmoving symbol in the midst of all of this unending and infinite movement. The dance symbolizes that God, represented in feminine form in this case, is the only thing that remains unchanging in a constantly changing universe (jagat).” Jiya is also an artist in acrylic painting and in sketching. She won three awards during her freshman year. Asked what she most likes to paint, she replied that she liked nature, landscapes and flowers. “I mostly paint from my imagination,” she shared. Her goals include graduating from MHS and then attending college. “I am undecided as of right now between Baylor University, Texas A&M University or the University of Texas at Austin. Wherever, I end up, I plan to major in biology and attend medical school to become a cardiologist.” Optimist Melissa Al-Amadhi thanked her for choosing cardiology, as did Optimists Richard Magrill and Le Ila Dixon. She shared that her interest was sparked by the medical condition of her little sister, Nishta. In a personal message to her parents, Mukund and Shilpa Mistry, she said: “Thank you for every sacrifice, support and always be there for me, whether it is the smallest thing or the biggest, you guys are always there for me no matter the situation. From Private School Interscholastic Activity, to volleyball to power lifting and all of my academic related accomplishments, you both have been present. Thank you for always being there. I love you guys so much! I am so proud to be your daughter.” President Julie then introduced Gavin Carlisle as the Young Texan for October. His favorite subject is chemistry and his favorite teachers are Janna Duck for algebra II, Glenda Bailey for business finance, Michael Wheeler for science, Golf Coach Casey Broadus and 12th Grade Counselor Kelley Paul. His grade point average is 5.167. Gavin is active in varsity golf, the National Honor Society and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. (He is captain of the golf team!) He enjoys bass fishing (with a buddy in Fern Lake) and deer, dove and hog hunting. Optimist Le Ila asked if he and his hunting buddies “eat what they kill.” He said, “Yes, but not the hogs; they are usually too tough. However, they don’t go to waste. There is a coyote problem, so the hog carcasses are used as bait for the coyotes!” He works at Marshall Mercantile, “doing whatever is needed.” “It’s a great place to work!” In response to questions, he reported that the ice cream parlor is now open with vanilla, chocolate and strawberry on offer. “Come by and have some,” he advised. As far as college is concerned, he is leaning toward the University of Arkansas but may end up someplace else. He plans to major in finance. In a personal message to his parents, Scott and Tracy Carlile, he said: “To my mom and dad, thank y’all so much for all of the unwavering support whether it was with school, golf, baseball and everything else. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without y’all. I love y’all so much,” and added, “have fun dealing with Ian [his younger brother] over the next four years” in recognition that he’s not leaving them with an empty nest! As promised, President Julie gave new MHS Principal Mike Miller the opportunity to introduce himself. He indicated that he began his career as an educator as a band director before moving into administration. This is his first year in Marshall. Due to various issues, his family is still in the house in Arp, but he is glad to be here in his new work. “It’s really great to be in a town where the community is so supportive of the schools!” he said. He reported on the progress and anticipated completion of the various physical improvements at the high school/junior high school campus. Total high school enrollment this year now stands at 1,477, and there are approximately 350 in the senior class. The Optimists gave the Young Texans and school administrators a round of applause. President Julie presented pots of large-petalled yellow and orange fall mums to the mothers and Optimist John Fortune took pictures. Note: John takes pictures throughout the meeting and President Julie shares these with the families.",

      "description": "It took a veritable village and then some to get the ground-breaking freeway art project off the ground.",
      "content": "As Carson City continues to reinvent itself into a city that has fallen in love with the outdoor visual arts, we want to remind our locals – old and new – how the wonderful metal art seen along the Carson stretch of I-580 came to be, for that amazing art project could be considered the birth of today’s local outdoor art movement. We often forget those who have made major impacts in our community. As we go forth in our enthusiasm for outdoor art, it is time to give credit where credit is due for this outdoor art movement that began in 1997 with the simple concept of encouraging landscaping for the future freeway. It took a veritable village and then some to get the ground-breaking freeway art project off the ground. The following is a far shortened version of the story that had so many interesting twists and turns including being in the right place at the right time. It all started when a soft-spoken Mary Fischer called NDOT asking whether her family could finance the landscaping of the interchange where the new freeway was to bypass the mobile home park she and her husband owned off Arrowhead Drive. NDOT was receptive to the idea and after meeting with NDOTs then landscape designer, Lucy Joyce, the idea for more than landscaping was born. It was Joyce who suggested the incorporation of art elements or “hardscape” and suggested incorporating Carson’s history into the landscape design. Not a stone was left unturned, blending art and landscaping even to the point of rearranging the stones that were dug up to create a pleasing visual “stonescape.” This home-grown project that began by a request to be able to eliminate possible blight on one small piece of land came to be a template for future statewide NDOT highway construction projects. Once Fischer got the encouragement to proceed, she was instrumental in starting the non-profit GROW, Gardeners Reclaiming Our Waysides, after meeting with the Carson City UNR Extension Master Growers who became “master promoters.” The end project you see today began as committed volunteers devoted thousands of hours to planning, promoting and studying Carson City’s rich history. Ah, but how to finance the first phase of this project? Fischer recruited then Mayor Marv Teixeira, who recruited his good friend the very powerful Nevada Sen. Harry Reid to pave the way. To gain support of Nevada’s politicians, the charismatic duo trekked to Washington, D.C., resulting in a $2 million funding from the Federal Highway Administration. The remaining $1 million was raised locally through donations and an NDOT grant. The first phase of the “Carson City in Motion” unique art project was completed in 2012 starting with the eagle – denoting our Eagle Valley – in flight at the north end and as each subsequent phase was completed, Carson’s history took shape. Today, the magnificent eagle, installed just before Christmas 2017 at the south end, is resting at the intersection of Carson Street, I-580, and Highway 50. In the brochure, Fischer refers to both eagles as “bookends to the rich historical story of Eagle Valley.” Those who want a short visual history of our city can make it a point to stop at the 15 sites to learn more about what makes Carson City history unique. A descriptive plaque is installed at each site, or you can refer to the free e-book found online: https://www.blurb.com/b/3850587-carson-city-s-history-in-motion?ebook=360767. Each Carson City interchange has a story to tell. From the explorers led by John C. Fremont in 1844 who reportedly traveled along Fairview Drive, to the coming of the Basque sheepherders depicted on Koontz Lane who settled here in the mid-1800s, on to Lt. Col. Eisenhower’s convoy passing through the Arrowhead Drive area to record the poor state of the coast-to-coast highway system in 1919, and ending at the southernmost interchange showing the settlement of the Washoe Tribe, these adventurers and settlers receive their due. Those who use the Arrowhead interchange will chuckle at the seasonally decorated “Ike” and his fellow soldiers with Santa hats provided by a citizen(s) with a sense of humor. As we go forth admiring the new mural art brought forth the past two years for our viewing pleasure and the new art to soon be installed at the round-about, we salute all the artists who continue to make our city more interesting while still remembering those who started it all in 1997. Today’s art guru is Eric Brooks, arts coordinator for the Carson City Visitors Bureau, who introduced the concept of murals in 2023 now seen all around the town. Anna Freeman of the Carson City Parks and Recreation Department shepherded the revitalization of the former firefighter’s memorial at Mills Park by the Carson City Chamber Leadership Class of 2024 to create an inviting space for locals to entertain or gather. Mary Fischer passed on Feb. 14, 2021; however, her gift to Carson City remains visible as she wrote: “It is easy to think that one person – one voice – means nothing in today’s complex society. A prevalent belief is that an individual cannot make a difference. One voice may make a small impact, but a voice combined with many other voices can change policy and procedures.” A fitting thought in these times. Go out and explore the art in our city whether for the historic knowledge or the colorful visual impact, for scientific studies continue to show art appreciation improves our quality of life and makes us feel good.",

      "description": "The \"Good Times\" star died earlier this summer, but the news was only announced Tuesday, exacerbating a bitter feud between his adult children.",
      "content": "“Good Times” star died of congestive heart failure more than a month ago, People reports. The news of his passing at 84 years old , though Amos had died more than one month earlier. His son, K.C. Amos, divulged at the time that natural causes were to blame. According to a death certificate , Amos died of congestive heart failure on Aug. 21 at 5:18 p.m. at a hospital in Inglewood. The certificate also confirmed Amos was cremated on Aug. 30 without a prior autopsy. The slow drip of news about the actor’s passing has exacerbated — who announced Wednesday that she only learned about her father’s death “through the media.” K.C. was the person who reported John Amos’ death to police, according to People. “We are devastated and left with many questions about how this happened 45 days ago, learning about it through the media like so many of you,” , adding she is “struggling” to process the “uncertainties surrounding his passing.” The patriarch’s death has only worsened the battle between K.C. and Shannon, who previously accused him online and in official filings with authorities in New Jersey and Colorado of “elder abuse,” isolating their father from the rest of the family and allegedly exploiting his finances. Shannon launched a GoFundMe in June 2023 in what she said was an effort to raise money for her father’s care. (Amos and said through his representative, Belinda Foster, that he was “doing well” and that the GoFundMe’s description of his situation was inaccurate.) The following month, K.C. was arrested after Shannon claimed via text message. Los Angeles police even opened an investigation into the matter but closed the case in April without bringing any charges against either party. In statements to news outlets, K.C. has denied all claims of abuse. Foster, meanwhile, on Friday attempted to clarify why Shannon hadn’t been notified. “At the time of John’s passing, K.C. was under a strict no-contact order from the Superior Court of New Jersey based on the Complaint that his sister Shannon brought against him in 2023,” she said. While the actor’s goddaughter, Amy Goudy, on behalf of herself and Shannon to suggest Amos “was likely cremated to avoid any potential investigation,” Foster revealed Friday that it was Amos himself who requested as much. “At the time of his death, John was concerned that Shannon might turn his death and internment into a circus as she had done with other aspects of his life,” she told People. “It was John who requested the delay in announcing his death to Shannon and the rest of the world.” Amos was best known as the father on “Good Times” but also for his role in the seminal 1977 miniseries “Roots.” Related...",

      "content": "With a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 7% and power demand rising by over 8% this year, India is now the third-largest power market globally, and its energy demand is set to triple by 2050, making it a critical investment destination, Alex Whitworth, Vice President & Head of Asia Pacific Power & Renewables Research, Wood Mackenzie said in a statement. He was speaking at industry event Renewable Energy India (REI) Expo organised by Informa Markets in India. “India’s role in the global energy transition is becoming increasingly prominent as its economy has overtaken the UK, surpassed France, and is on track to overtake major markets like Germany and Japan within the next five to ten years, he added. Stating that renewables are expanding rapidly, with over 200 GW of solar and wind capacity expected by 2030, he said India’s emergence as the second-largest solar module manufacturer, exporting to key global markets, highlights its potential. “However, 70% of India’s power still comes from coal, with 50 GW of coal and 10 GW of nuclear expected by 2030. In a net-zero scenario, electrification would need to exceed 50%, a crucial focus for India as it balances its development of fossil fuel and electric economies in parallel to meet its growing energy demands,” he said. He said the country must address challenges in energy storage, grid infrastructure, and renewable deployment, while leveraging its domestic market and global partnerships to drive a low-carbon future. Speaking on the occasion Shantanu Jaiswal, Head of India Research, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF), said the year 2023 marked an unprecedented climate milestone, for the first time, global surface temperatures exceeded 2°C above pre-industrial levels for several days. “What’s more concerning is that greenhouse gas emissions have not yet peaked, indicating that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades. In response to these challenges, there is a growing global focus on energy transition. India is at the forefront of this transition, with estimates from Bloomberg India suggesting that by 2030, the country will have more solar and wind projects than coal power plants,” he said. Emphasising that intermittency of renewable energy presents a significant challenge, making battery energy storage systems (BESS) essential for ensuring grid stability and enhancing renewable integration, he said global energy demand is projected to triple, increasing from 1.8 terawatt hours to over 5 terawatt hours by 2050, primarily due to advancements in storage technology. “Batteries play a crucial role not only in the power sector but also in transportation. India’s electric mobility sector is growing rapidly, with major automakers establishing battery assembly plants and leveraging the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to create 50 gigawatt hours of battery manufacturing capacity,” he said in a statement. “Demand for lithium-ion batteries is anticipated to rise from 10 gigawatt hours today to 200 gigawatt hours by 2035, fueled by the electric vehicle market and grid-scale storage needs,” he added. Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets in India, said “India’s strides in domestic lithium-ion battery production were particularly noteworthy, with production capacity expected to reach 150 gigawatt hours by 2030, covering 13% of total cell demand.” Published - October 05, 2024 09:56 pm IST Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

      "content": "The Shiba Inu (SHIB) craze brought a lucky trader an-eye-popping $30 million and this lucky trader is now keen to get hold of Rexas Finance (RXS) token. Why is this seasoned investor so adamant about Rexas Finance, which is currently valued at merely $0.050 in presale stage 3? This generous venture capitalist has strong predictions for this cryptocurrency likely to go astronomical from below $0.12 up to a mind-boggling $12 by the year 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Future of Crypto The Tokens of Rexas Finance (RXS) cannot be termed as normal tokens. In just a handful of days, Rexas Finance has progressed over time as evidenced by the impressive presale figures. The price of the token started at $0.030 during phase one, rose to $0.040 in phase two, and is $0.050 in phase three. A considerable increase of nearly 69.7% has been achieved over this period which is greatly buoyed by the active participation of investors. As it stands 73.53% of the presale stage 3 is sold out which signals that there is an opportunity for smart investors as this is a reasonable discount. Those who vowed to board this time around will have huge dividends to count on since the likely listing price is apprehended to be a whopping $0.20. This means that those buying Rexas Finance now at the current price of $0.050 will end up making 6x ROI when the token starts trading at $0.2. However, this is only a snapshot of where the flexibility is... Jine Angel",

      "content": "The cryptocurrency market is often associated with high risks due to the promise it bears to reap vast returns within a short period, with some coins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki Inu (FLOKI) previously reaping tremendous rewards to their very early investors. However, new contenders from emerging Rexas Finance (RXS) are coming up with other useful utilities and value additions to the ever-crowded field of cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Coin with Deflationary Potential Though your chances of becoming a millionaire overnight like some early investors were in 2021 when Shiba Inu exploded over 50,000,000% within a month, the possibility is still there. At the moment, SHIB has a price of $0.000015, and while these days of out-of-body experiences may seem over this was arguably one of the most popular and commonly possessed meme coins ever. However, Shibarium stands to be the way forward for the token as investors stand to benefit more from its L2 solution with the addition of a fast and efficient layer to the ecosystem.Shibarium's burn system is perhaps the most notable attribute of the platform, whose intent is to lower SHIB's huge circulating supply, pegged at 589 trillion tokens. All transactions made on Shibarium include a part of SHIB that is remotely burnt, creating a level of deflationary pressure on the token. More supply curbs could bring upward price pressure if demand is strong enough. This is essential because, without a serious cut on the supply, there is no way that people are going to be able to realistically fantasize over SHIB attaining $1 or even about $0.01. However, the launch of Shibarium and its deflationary model regulate supply to spur further growth for SHIB in the next bull run.In addition, SHIB has launched a DeFi platform— ShibaSwap, and continues development in the direction of the metaverse and NFTs, thus increasing the token utility as well. It's clear that there is no chance of SHIB reaching $1 very soon, but it is... Jine Angel",

      "content": "Published on Oct 5, 2024 at 5:00 PM Updated on Oct 5, 2024 at 11:22 AM A prominent TRON whale has made waves in the cryptocurrency market by shifting focus from Chainlink (LINK) to a lesser-known alternative poised for massive gains. This move has stirred discussions, especially as analysts predict the new investment could yield significant returns by 2024. With the rise of decentralized platforms and AI-powered financial ecosystems, this transition could begin a substantial shift in the market landscape. Chainlink Price Performance Chainlink (LINK), currently priced at $10.78, has long been a favorite among crypto investors. Its reliable performance and market cap, which have placed it at position eighteen in the rankings, have made it a strong contender in the decentralized oracle space. However, the recent LINK price fluctuations, including a 4.4% drop over 24 hours and a more significant 11.6% decrease over the last seven days, have raised questions among some investors. These concerns are heightened by its volatile price range, which has moved between $10.45 and $11.30 in just 24 hours. Following the current market volatility, the TRON whale, who had previously placed substantial capital into Chainlink, is reassessing the long-term potential of LINK, seeing that the price outlook is bearish. The whale has shifted focus to a newer project called RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI-driven decentralized platform. With predictions of up to 2000% returns by Q4 2024, its native token, RCOF, could be the next big player in decentralized markets. Why Has the TRON Whale Invested in RCO Finance (RCOF) RCO Finance (RCOF), a relatively new entrant in the DeFi space, has attracted attention. Investors are watching closely as its presale navigates the second stage, and the token's price has already surged 169% to $0.0344 from its initial price. The current presale stage is just the beginning; in the next stage, RCOF is expected to rise even further to $0.05588. The token... Jine Angel",

      "content": "Industry actor Marisa Abela thinks her character Yasmin’s intimate scenes in the show should be toned down in the next seasons of the hit finance drama. Abela plays publishing heiress turned financial analyst Yasmin in Industry, which follows a bunch of finance graduates that look for jobs after the 2008 financial crisis. Abela, whose character has been in numerous explicit scenes, told The Times of London newspaper: “I understand that it’s part of the show. I think I’m just more careful now about what it is that’s being seen.” She continued: “The nudity aspect is not something that I minded in season one or two — it was like, ‘If it’s in my contract, I’ll do it.’ It was part of Yasmin and part of the fact that she was so comfortable with herself and she’s very free. And it didn’t have a lot of emotional weight for me.” She added: “It’s not like anyone would have made me do something that I didn’t want to do, but I didn’t necessarily want to question the directors. But I think now I’m more aware of the implications of doing it over and over again. And I’m more aware that I have the ability to say, ‘Do you mind staying on my back rather than coming round the front? You get the idea from my back that I’m not wearing anything.’” The actress, who played Amy Winehouse in biopic Back To Black, explained why she thinks explicit scenes make sense for such a show. She said: “I think that money, power and s*x often go hand in hand. And if you’re sitting behind a desk all day dealing in hundreds of millions of pounds for other people, and then making yourself a big bonus and going out a lot, there are only so many dynamics that you can play out in that workplace before it becomes s*xual. And I think whenever there’s a big red button, everyone’s instinct is always to push it.” Alon with Marisa Abela , Industry stars Kit Harington, Harry Lawtey, Freya Mavor and more.",

      "description": "Daniel Craig, transitioning from his James Bond persona, now features in Loewe's Fall-Winter 2024 campaign with a new playful style. Chunky knitwear is a key element. Handknits are gaining popularity globally, and Indian brands like Kilmora, Margn, and Peoli are leading the trend with sustainable, creative designs that blend tradition and modernity.",
      "content": "Is Daniel Craig having a midlife crisis? Or is he just rediscovering the fun side of fashion as he hangs up the stiff James Bond suit and the stiffer upper lip that comes with it? In the oddest yet the most interesting fashion collaboration this year, the actor is the face of the Spanish luxury fashion house Loewe, led by creative director Jonathan Anderson, who is known for his idiosyncratic aesthetic. Craig shook and stirred things up at the Paris Fashion Week when he wore a chunky, technicolour knit sweater. In Loewe’s Fall-Winter 2024 campaign, his styles were a clear departure from the past. But everyone noticed the knits. Says knitwear and menswear designer Taarini Anand: “Craig’s campaign brilliantly signified a shift in his image from Bond to a wacky, Big Lebowski-inspired era for him, and it’s exciting to see chunky jumpers play a key role in that transformation.” Anand is quick to point that chunky knits never truly disappeared, “Designers like Jonathan. Anderson and brands like The Elder Statesman have consistently showcased them through the years.” Cardigan is a signature piece of artisanal clothing brand Kartik Research, too, she adds. It is good news for fashionistas. Some of us may have knitwear made by grandma or ma tucked away in a mothballed existence. It is time to air them out as the season and trends beckon. And if you don’t have one in the corner of the cupboard, there are homegrown labels, social enterprises and brands championing the cause of handknits . HILLS ARE ALIVE Many of these knitwear brands are based in the hills and valleys of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. They work with artisans and traditional practices, often giving a new spin to the old. Kilmora is a social enterprise working out of Kumaon for 27 years. When its knitting group was started by cofounder Lakshmi Lall in 1998, there were just 15 women. Now, it has 13 decentralised groups with almost 670 women. Anamika Das, MD of Kilmora, says this is a testimony to the growing appeal of handknits. For a small village collective, it is very responsive to trends. “Here, in our villages, we are seeing the influence of K-dramas—loose fits and drapes and patterned sweaters, to name a few,” she says. Das says it is important to see the signs of change: “We must accept climate change. Shorter winters have led us to work on creating cotton knits. We have short tops and our classic 3/4 sleeve sweater in cotton knits.” Artificial Intelligence(AI) AI for Everyone: Understanding and Applying the Basics on Artificial Intelligence By - Ritesh Vajariya, Generative AI Expert View Program Office Productivity Zero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide 2024 By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, Developer and Lead Instructor View Program Marketing Digital Marketing Masterclass by Neil Patel By - Neil Patel, Co-Founder and Author at Neil Patel Digital Digital Marketing Guru View Program Marketing Digital Marketing Masterclass by Pam Moore By - Pam Moore, Digital Transformation and Social Media Expert View Program Legal Data Privacy with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) By - Arun S.

Founded by Ranjit Yadav and Saurabh Maurya, alumni of NIFT Bengaluru, in 2021, Margn is making waves globally. Maurya says he fell in love with knitwear when he came across Bhuttico, a weavers’ cooperative society in Kullu, as a graduate student. Now Margn works with women weavers in Kullu and Janjheli in Himachal Pradesh. Says Maurya: “Handknits are not just a product but a narrative deeply intertwined with our creative and manufacturing processes.” Maurya and Yadav mix functionality, craft and symbolism by deconstructing traditional forms of knitwear to create new avatars like handknitted puffer jackets and handwoven, water-resistant jackets that use the quilting technique called Sujani. Maurya says: “Now there are so many new brands in knitwear, even with two months of winter.” The short season doesn’t deter the brands as they are finding audiences abroad, thanks to increasing digitalisation. Swati Seth, founder of The Color Caravan, says, “Since wool has a limited market in India, we should take indigenous wool knitwear to the international market, especially the Scandinavian countries.” The Color Caravan is based out of Naggar, a village in Kullu. A socially driven handmade manufacturer, it works with native crafts and herding communities to preserve local craft and revive local wool. Seth says knitwear is trend agnostic as classic designs like Fair Isle jumpers, cables and ribbed knits are timeless. “We also create contemporary silhouettes like hand-knitted capes and ribbed pencil skirts,” she says. The Color Caravan works with Desi Oon Hub, which works with indigenous sheep wool. Seth says, “What has gotten lost over the years is the use of native wool, which has been replaced by acrylic yarn. However, initiatives like Desi Oon Hub are helping to revive it.” Vasanthi Veluri, cofounder of Peoli, an apparel brand based in Kumaon, says, “The world over, there has been a growing focus on handcrafted and ethically produced knitwear. While handknits remain a small segment, their unique appeal is drawing attention from discerning consumers.” Peoli, built on the principles of sustainable living, works with local artisans and organic raw material. At Peoli, they knit not only wool but also other materials like kala cotton, Himalayan nettle, hemp and eri silk to overcome the limitations of seasonality. They also play with multi-functionality in garments, like shawls that double up as scarves. Veluri says the growing emphasis on slow fashion and sustainability has ensured their products, which are made in Almora, have found a place in New York, London and Paris. “We prefer to keep designs classical while our silhouettes are mostly antifits and unisex so that they are easier to execute and will last for several seasons,” says Veluri. Peoli’s cofounders, Veluri and Abhinav Dhoundiyal, say the future of knitwear in India is bright. “In the past six-seven years, many brands and boutiques have started collaborating with local artisans,” says Veluri. For Saloni Jain, knitwear, especially chunky jumpers, stirs a deep sense of nostalgia and comfort. The knitwear designer says, “The resurgence of chunky knitwear reflects a growing appreciation for slow fashion and artisanal craftsmanship.” Jain says there is immense potential for this segment in India. Her pointers for being on-trend with a chunky sweater are to have a simple, well-fitted shirt underneath and to pair it with tailored trousers. Prerna Nainwal and her mother Geeta Nainwal, who founded Nainital-based OhKu Studio, want to represent Uttarakhand’s heritage. Says Prerna: “In India, we often conflate knitwear with woollen wear, viewing it solely as attire for winter. But knitwear can be versatile. By using cotton yarn or exploring crochet techniques, we can create summerfriendly options.” How do you wear and pair knitwear? The possibilities are endless, says Prerna. Muskan Soni, founder of craft-forward brand Khajoor Studio, Jaipur, suggests pairing chunky sweaters with solid-coloured shirt and trousers or pencil skirt. Soni, a graduate in knitwear design from NIFT, New Delhi, says knits rooted in craft and artisanal skills and classic pieces like relaxed cardigans and loose sweaters will do well in the seasons to come. While handknitting is a craft passed down generations, Soni says it’s getting lost. “To truly value it, we need to start looking at it from the point of luxury. It’s a hand process and it is slow—it takes 8 to 10 days to knit a sweater. Luxury takes time. Once consumers understand that, it will be a premium product that everyone would want.” As Das says, “The world is recognising the need to slow down, become mindful and present. Knitting is one of the easiest ways to tick all these boxes.” So a handknit jumper is cosy, mindful and surprisingly on-trend. And if it’s good enough for Bond, even if former, it’s good enough for you. (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel )",

      "content": "In commemoration of the 2024 Pensioners Day, National leadership of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) has appealed to President Bola Tinubu to consider the sacrifices of pensioners to the country and make their lives more meaningful by finding sustainable solutions to their plight. President of NUP, Comrade Godwin Abumisi in a ceremony to mark the annual event on Saturday in Abuja themed, “The Unresolved Economic Hardship in Nigeria and its Traumatic Effects on the Lives of Nigerian Pensioners/Older Persons,’ regretted that some pensioners have died prematurely due to inability to afford drugs and other essentials, as a result of the harsh economy further worsened by the removal of fuel subsidy. While commending the Federal Government for the 20% pension increase already paid to some members, the NUP urged government to enable pensioners’ access to free medical care, transport fares but most importantly, payment of the 2015 pension review, payment of the outstanding N33 billion from the N78 billion owed Retired Nigeria Airways worker when the company was liquidated in 2004. He said: “Pensioners represent those who worked to build the country during their active working lives. “They are part of those who built the country to what it is today, such as the infrastructure, the capital formation, the development of the educated classes, are all fruits of their past efforts and service to the nation. “Justice therefore demands that all those who worked to bring the country to where it is today are not only adequately rewarded by the payment of their hard-earned entitlements, but should be as well recognized and respected for their heroic labour past by way of granting them access to free medical care, free transport services etc. as obtained in other civilized climes of the world.” Abumisi added, “We would like to commend the past administration under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR for the approval and payment of the various pension reviews to the deserving pensioners. But regrettably, as I address you, the pension review of 2015 was omitted and has suffered series of setback as it has not been paid, despite all efforts invested in the struggle for its actualization. “We therefore humbly appeal to the Federal Government under the able leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR to come to our aid by putting in place necessary government instruments towards making funds available for the payment of this omitted pension review of 2015 which would serve as another form of palliatives, to put smile on the faces of the benefitting pensioners across the country. “The Federal government in its wisdom decided to liquidate the Nigeria Airways in 2004 of which both the workers and the existing pensioners were paid off by the Olusegun Obasanjo GCRF’s administration. “The pay-off was calculated and put at N78 billion, being the total liability. Out of the N78 billion, the sum of N45 billion was released and paid by the last administration, leaving a balance of N33 billion unsettled. “While commending the bold steps taken by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to approve, release and pay the sum of N45 billion out of the N78 billion. “We wish to passionately appeal to the present administration in line with its ‘Renewed Hope Agenda’ to kindly rise to the occasion by directing the Presidential initiative continuous Audit (PICA), under the Federal Ministry of Finance, charged with the responsibility of handling this payment to expedite action on this pending payment without further delay, as many pensioners in this category waiting for the payment have died without enjoying the full fruits of their labour. The pensioners also called for a review of the Contributory Pensions Scheme, harmonization of pension, an end to discriminatory practices against Contributory pensioners including non release of timely monthly accrued rights to contributory pensioners. “The cardinal purpose of introducing the Contributory Pension Scheme was to address the shortcoming/challenges inherent in the old pension scheme (Defined Benefit Scheme). But unfortunately and regrettably too, the reverse has been the case as the present condition of pensioners under the Contributory Pension Scheme is very pitiable and paints a gloomy picture, as many of them are daily lamenting and crying for help, considering the paltry sum they receive as monthly pension. “This is as a result of the Pension Reform Act policy which compels them to join annuity operated by insurance companies or programmed withdrawal operated by Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) under the supervision of PENCOM. “What is happening at the Contributory Pension Scheme is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. For instance, a retiree under the Contributory Pension Scheme today is entitled to a programmed withdrawal of 25% as his monthly pension while the balance of 75% is retained by the PFAs for investments with high returns that hardly reflect in their paltry monthly pension, despite the huge profit declared every year by the PFAs. “The NUP sees this as an exploitation and enslavement of the Contributory Pensioners and calls for its review. “Regrettably and unfortunately, the recent two circulars released for pension review of 20% increment of 30th April, 2024 via circular number SWC/S/04/S.542/11/449 and the N32,000 pension increase as a result of the N70,000 new national minimum wage via circular number SWC 04/T/140 of 23rd September, 2024 omitted the Contributory Pension Scheme pensioners. “While pensioners under the Defined Benefit Scheme enjoy all manner of pension reviews/increments across board in accordance with the provisions of the 1999 Nigeria constitution, the Contributory Pensioners are exempted from these benefits and left to their fate, yet both the pensioners under the contributory pension Scheme and that of Defined Benefits Scheme face the same adverse market condition and inflation. Non-implementation of Arrears of Pension Increment of 15%, 33% and the Consequential Adjustment of 2007, 2010 and 2019 respectively to Pensioners Under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). “We hereby call on the Federal Government to order the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to find a way out of this discriminatory policy to address this injustice.”",

Spanning 3,000 acres, the Wildlife Animal Reserve, situated within the Jamnagar Refinery Complex in Gujarat, has gained attention for its efforts in preserving both ecosystems and wildlife. Recently, the Ambani family added another remarkable feature to the Vantara project, further enhancing its mission.",
      "content": "Anant Ambani , the younger son of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani launched Vantara , a new endeavour to rehabilitate wild animals last year. The 3,000-acre Wildlife Animal Reserve, which is located at the Jamnagar Refinery Complex in Gujarat, has been in the news for protecting the ecosystem and animals. The Ambanis introduced yet another exciting feature in Vantara. From October 4 to 6, 2024, three wildlife-themed sculptures will be exhibited at prominent spots in Mumbai—Carter Road, Shivaji Park, and Juhu Beach—highlighting how wildlife is endangered due to the exploitative nature of human consumption. Crafted from wire mesh and locally sourced materials, these sculptures serve not only as artistic creations but also as a thought-provoking call for awareness. Each artwork depicts wildlife entangled with human waste, subtly but powerfully reminding us of how our everyday actions, from plastic consumption to urban development, harm natural ecosystems. One sculpture shows an Asian Black Bear with its head stuck in a discarded plastic container, illustrating how animals often become unintended casualties of human pollution. Another installation features two Flamingos entangled in plastic, symbolizing the destruction of bird habitats caused by pollution. The Juhu Beach exhibit shifts its focus to marine life, presenting a simple yet moving sculpture of turtles trapped in fishing nets and surrounded by debris, portraying the struggles sea creatures face in their polluted environment. This initiative is part of Vantara's larger mission to safeguard wildlife and rehabilitate ecosystems. With its 3,500-acre sanctuary in Gujarat, Vantara has led efforts in wildlife rescue, rehabilitation, and reforestation, helping to protect over 1 million animals and plant 100 million trees. These actions are part of a broader vision to harmonize human development with environmental preservation . It is also an artistic endeavour is an attempt to remind people how their choices affect the wellbeing of sentient creatures.

      "content": "Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath held a meeting with Makhtar Diop, the global managing director of the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ), in Lucknow on Saturday. They discussed the state's development towards a USD 1 trillion economy and collaboration in the areas of infrastructure and agricultural technology. Accompanied by chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, the CM and the IFC delegation explored the possibility of public-private partnership (PPP) projects. IFC showed particular interest in contributing to the state's development in infrastructure and AgTech. IFC is an international financial institution that offers investment, advisory, and asset-management services to countries and is a member of the World Bank Group. Diop said IFC has been providing support for many important projects in India for the past several years. \"IFC committed USD 200 million to IndiGrid, India's first and largest power sector infrastructure investment trust, supporting the modernisation of India's transmission sector through asset monetisation. At the same time, IFC actively engages in PPP transaction advisory for innovative renewable energy projects,\" he said. Currently, IFC and the World Bank Group are working with the state govt to increase infrastructure investment in urban areas of the state. Cities with a population of more than 1 million, like Kanpur, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Agra, Varanasi, Meerut, and Prayagraj, are likely to become part of this initiative. Diop mentioned that IFC and the World Bank Group (WBG) can jointly help establish a pooled financing structure for the state to attract private capital into urban infrastructure. A pooled commercial financing structure could draw on the financial strength of UP to address collective funding requirements for urban infrastructure, he added. The official said that with the support of the WBG 100 Cities programme, a state intermediary could raise loans on a pooled basis with a govt guarantee or credit enhancement. The WBG-ADB 100 Cities programme, in coordination with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, aims to deliver bankable projects in water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management services in 100 cities. The programme is in its preparatory stages. Since 2007, IFC has invested nearly USD 750 million in 29 projects in sectors such as chemicals and fertilisers, housing, renewable energy, telecommunications, health, and food processing. IFC also signed an MoU with the Department of Infrastructure and Industrial Development in July 2023, under which IFC is providing advisory services for the procurement, operation, and maintenance of e-buses. It has also engaged with the UP govt for advisory on PPPs and AgTech. It was previously engaged as a transaction advisor on the Jhansi Solar Project to assist the client in structuring and tendering a solar power park project of 600MW in Jhansi. IFC has also contributed to several projects to promote investment in AgTech in UP. Under this, IFC's India Agritech Advisory Project (IAAP) is benefiting more than 30,000 farmers, he said. IFC has also invested in sewage treatment plant projects for the revival of the Ganga river in collaboration with the Jal Nigam and the National Mission for Clean Ganga on a PPP mode.",

      "description": "As per ANAROCK data, the top seven cities collectively saw over 44% of price appreciation in the last five years. At a city level, Hyderabad recorded the highest jump of 64% between 2019 and H1 2024, followed by Bengaluru with a 57% increase. The lowest price growth of 25% was seen in Kolkata.",
      "content": "Residential property prices have surged across India’s top cities over the last five years, driven by robust demand and an increase in new supply, stated a recent report by ANAROCK Research. Among the short-listed localities by the real-estate consultant, Bengaluru's Bagaluru area emerged as the frontrunner, witnessing a staggering 94% increase in residential prices between 2019 and the first half of the 2024. The average property prices in this area jumped from Rs 4,300 per square foot in 2019 to approximately Rs 8,151 per square foot in H1 2024. During this period, around 17,065 new units were launched in Bagaluru, predominantly in the mid and premium segments — Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore. Notably, there was no new affordable supply in this locality, says Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group. \"Bagaluru’s transformation reflects a growing preference for premium living amidst increasing urbanization and economic growth. With demand outpacing supply, it’s clear why developers are focusing on higher-end offerings,\" Puri adds. Hyderabad’s Kokapet closely followed with an 89% price appreciation during the five-year period. The average residential price in this micro-market rose from Rs 4,750 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 9,000 per square foot as of H1 2024, bolstered by approximately 12,920 new units. Interestingly, over half (52%) of the new supply fell into the ultra-luxury category, priced above Rs 2.5 crore, indicating a trend towards luxury living. With 80% rise in average residential property prices, Bengaluru's Whitefield ranked third. Average property price climbed from Rs 4,765 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 8,600 per square foot in H1 2024 in the micro-market. This area saw a total of 18,600 units launched, with 66% categorised in the mid-and-premium segments. As per the report, NCR’s (National Capital Region) Dwarka Expressway ranked fourth. It saw a 79% price surge in the residential housing property. Average housing prices in this area increased from Rs 5,359 per square foot in 2019 to over Rs 9,600 per square foot in H12024.

The average prices here rose from Rs 5,870 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 9,300 per square foot in H1 2024. Hyderabad’s Bachupally came in sixth with average property prices increasing by 57% in the period – from Rs 3,690 per square foot in 2019 to over Rs 5,800 per square foot in H1 2024. Hyderabad’s Tellapur ranked seventh, with average property prices surging by 53%, from Rs 4,819 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 7,350 per square foot in H1 2024. Following closely, MMR’s Panvel secured the eighth position, witnessing a 50% increase in property prices during the same period. Prices here climbed from Rs 5,520 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 8,300 per square foot in H1 2024. NCR’s New Gurugram, occupying the ninth spot, recorded a 48% rise in average property prices, which escalated from Rs 6,100 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 9,000 per square foot in H1 2024. Lastly, MMR’s Dombivli experienced a 40% increase in average prices, with housing prices from Rs 6,625 per square foot in 2019 to Rs 9,300 per square foot in H1 2024. Puri explains, “The general belief that increased supply restricts price growth is not always applicable. Many active residential micro-markets have defied this trend. For instance, Greater Noida West, despite significant new supply, saw a remarkable 129% price appreciation.” As cities continue to evolve and attract a diverse range of buyers, including professionals and investors, the demand for housing remains robust. With urbanisation on the rise and new projects continuously being launched, the trajectory for property prices seems poised for sustained growth, creating both opportunities and challenges for prospective buyers and developers alike. In conclusion, as the housing market adapts to post-pandemic realities, the balance of demand and supply will be crucial in shaping the future landscape of residential real estate in India’s major cities.",

      "description": "Therapists often face unique challenges in romantic relationships. Their skills in listening and support can become burdensome, leading to expectations of free advice and emotional support. Some struggle with maintaining professional boundaries, while others inadvertently adopt therapeutic roles. Despite these difficulties, some find ways to balance their professional and personal lives.",
      "content": "Will I get stood up? Will we hit it off ? Will there be awkward silences? These are some of the common fears people have about their first date. Sheetal Nimbalkar’s worst fear is a first date turning into a therapy session . “My first two dates with someone recently felt like hour-long sessions where I was listening to them vent the whole time, just because I asked the right questions,” recalls Nimbalkar, a counselling psychologist from Mumbai. She has stopped mentioning her profession on dating apps, lest people are drawn to her for that reason. Some therapists steer clear of dating apps altogether, she says. They are uncomfortable with clients finding them online and discovering personal information that can hamper the therapist-client dynamic. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, therapists have gained wide acceptance, especially in urban areas. However, this newfound understanding of their profession may have inadvertently complicated their romantic lives more than those of others. Nimbalkar, 31, says as soon as her dates find out she is a therapist, many of them start asking questions like, “Am I being avoidant?” or “Do you see any red flags in me?” People watch pop psychology reels on Instagram and throw these terms around on dates, she reckons. “I didn’t even know what a ‘red flag’ (slang for a warning sign) meant,” she says, exasperated. One date texted her asking if they were in a “limerence”—a psychological term for intense infatuation. “The expectation to put on my therapist’s hat while on a date is annoying,” she says. Nimbalkar has also been rejected by dates who were worried she might analyse them too well. Some dates stayed, not for romance, but for emotional support . “It made me question whether I am so attuned to a one-way relationship of being a listener that holding space for others is now my default even in situations where I deserve reciprocation,” she says. Being trained to listen to and support others often creates a lot of pressure on therapists in their romantic lives, says Farah Maneckshaw, a counselling psychologist from Bengaluru. “You are expected to behave like higher humans, to know better.

PARTNER THERAPY? SORRY! Mamta Shah, a clinical psychologist from Ahmedabad with over two decades of experience, says, “Partners often expect therapists to read their mood swings as if we are some sort of experts. It shocks them to realise we are also humans. We don’t have all the answers, we are just more attuned to listening.” Akshay Chari, 29, acknowledges that he has, in the past, held similar expectations from his therapist wife whom he dated for four years before they got married two years ago. “I would expect her to handle our fights better than me because of her line of work,” he admits. “I know better now.” Chari works as a DJ in Goa. As he strives to be more emotionally available for his wife, he wishes she would drop the therapist role she sometimes takes on when they are discussing something serious. “Therapists tend to dig deep every time,” he says. “It can get a bit overwhelming sometimes.” Avneet Kaur knows this all too well. “My partner has seen me before I became a therapist, so the change feels more pronounced for him,” says the counselling psychologist from Bengaluru. “He can tell when I shift into the therapist mode. When our conversations get deeper, he says, I start speaking more slowly and calmly. He doesn’t like it; it makes him feel put on the spot.” Budding therapists end up analysing (or therapising) their partners without realising it, says Shah. “Over time, they learn to avoid it or keep it to themselves,” she adds. “Having exhausted themselves listening to many emotional stories through the day, they also struggle with emotional bandwidth for partners in the initial years. With time, they learn to draw boundaries.” Kaur, 27, agrees, having worked on drawing professional boundaries in the last couple of years. She, however, feels her training helps her rationalise a lot of her concerns with her partner instead of sitting with her anger. “In certain situations, I put the psychologist’s hat away now,” she says. Most therapists feel their partners tend to lean more on them emotionally than they can in return. Anand Prasad, 38, a m a n a g e m e n t consultant who recently married a psychotherapist after four years of dating, acknowledges it: “At first, I was more emotionally dependent on her than I was emotionally available for her. I struggled on days when she had limited emotional bandwidth because of her work. Now, I’m working on being her emotional support.” His partner , Anshuma Kshetrapal, a creative arts psychotherapist, believes Prasad already has the emotional intelligence to help her recognise when to step out of her therapist role in their relationship. “A few weeks after losing his father, while still coping with the grief, Anand told me he realised he had been placing an unfair share of that burden on me because I’m a therapist. He reminded me that I’m not responsible for his grief,” says the 37-year-old from Delhi. “Honestly, I think about that moment very often.” Prasad says Kshetrapal’s role as a therapist is among “the reasons I love her”. “When we first met, I didn’t fully grasp what her work involved, but now I see that being a good therapist requires being a good person. The way she shows up for her clients inspires me,” he says. Reflecting on this, Kshetrapal says, “Many people study psychology to become the support they once needed. Those who have faced rejection and abandonment often develop deep empathy, which makes them skilled therapists. In short, my personality closely aligns with my professional persona.” WORK & HOME A challenge therapists often grapple with in a relationship is that they cannot discuss their work day with their partner. They can discuss their clients’ issues only with their supervisor. “It can be frustrating not being able to share a significant part of your life with your partner,” says Kaur. Work parlance does feature in relationships now and then. Divija Bhasin, 27, admits to having used a psychological term or two during a fight with her partner. “It’s because I’m able to communicate better that way. I explain myself in case my partner doesn’t understand it,” says the Delhi-based psychotherapist. Her partner, Amod Bhanushali, coruns her mental health startup, The Friendly Couch. “I am not intimidated by her being a therapist. Nor do I worry about her getting an upper hand in an argument because of her psychology vocabulary,” says Bhanushali. Using professional jargon in a fight can be tricky as it sometimes does in the case of Tejendra Singh. The 26-year-old clinical psychologist from Bengaluru is in a relationship with someone from the same profession. “Since we are both therapists, we end up throwing professional jargon during fights. Once when my partner was angry, I told her, ‘Maybe you should try some emotional regulation skills, it’ll help you.’ She got angrier,” he says. “She too has used technical terms on me. We do this when we are emotional but it is very off-putting and invalidating because we know that is Dating Life of Therapist We go to therapists to untangle our lives and love lives, but what does it mean to be in a romantic relationship as a therapist? Do their dates look for or fear a free therapy session? Akshay Chari, 29, acknowledges that he has, in the past, held similar expectations “A few weeks after my partner lost his father, he told me he realised he had been placing an unfair burden of his grief on me because I am a therapist” Anshuma Kshetrapal, creative arts psychotherapist, Delhi ised against you.” In Bengaluru’s startup world, Maneckshaw has heard of instances where someone swiped right on a therapist but have an even bigger challenge,” she adds. “You are working with pist role she sometimes takes on when they are discussing something serious. “Therapists tend to dig deep every time,” he says. “It can get a bit overwhelming sometimes.” Avneet Kaur knows this all too well. “My partner has seen me before I became a “At first, I was more emotionally dependent on her than I was emotionally available for her. I’m now working on being her emotional support” Anand Prasad, Anshuma’s partner invalidating because we know that is how we talk to clients,” he adds. Therapist couples have to struggle particularly hard not to bring their work into their personal lives. “You have to be mindful that you can’t be in your relationship what you are in sessions,” says psychotherapist Aziz M, 33, who has been in a relationship with a psychologist for three years now. “In therapy, you prepare for sessions; clients need your help. In a relationship, you are not together to fix each other. It has taken us time to understand that,” he adds. There are some upsides to this dynamic. “Our conflict resolution is better than regular people’s perhaps,” says psycholog i s t S i n g h f r o m Bengaluru. “Instead of panicking and jumping to find solutions, we give each other time to calm down because we are trained like that. We feel the burden to understand. But once in two-three months, we shove all psychology aside and fight like regular people,” he admits. There are also benefits to being a regular person in a relationship with a t h e r a p i s t . Bhasin says due to her profession, she has learned to “respond rather than react”. “I now communicate my feelings in clear words —‘I want more attention’, ‘I didn’t like it when you did this.’ And I have noticed my partner also does the same now, something he didn’t do earlier.” He also throws in psychological jargon while fighting. “In a way, he has also become ‘therapisty,’” she says.

      "description": "After 64 years of independence and over six decades of oil exploration, crude oil accounts for less than 10 percentread more Nigeria’s oil machine creaks 64 years after",
      "content": "After 64 years of independence and over six decades of oil exploration, crude oil accounts for less than 10 percent of Nigeria’s GDP but represents about 90 percent of foreign exchange earnings and more than half of government revenue. Endowed with some of the world’s biggest proven oil reserves of 37 billion barrels, Nigeria had the potential to break into the global stage to take an active position in decisions on international energy demand and supply issues alongside most of the world’s biggest oil producers. Nigeria and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had collectively agreed on how much oil to produce, with a view to exerting considerable influence on the global market price of oil and, understandably, keep it relatively high in order to maximise profitability. In 1973, the cartel was able to influence an oil boom which saw prices quadruple from $3 per barrel to $12 per barrel. Also, between 2006 and 2009, the price of oil went from $74.59 to $109.25. Again, from 2010 to 2013, the price of oil rose from $84.24 to $100.95. Life after oil During these boom periods, most oil-producing countries ran successful economies and also learned not to put all their eggs in one basket by intensifying plans for life beyond crude oil, a point Africa’s biggest oil-producing country missed. For instance, Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, took full advantage of the sustained rising oil prices to build new cities. The projects were designed to burnish the country’s image, develop a non-oil economy and generate enough employment to maintain social stability. For the UAE, building an economy less dependent on the ups and downs of the price of oil, but with a skilled workforce in many different industries, is beyond lip service. The country has a development plan for the next 50 years after 2021 called “2020: Towards the next 50.” The plan aims to strengthen the country’s investment in future generations with a focus on advanced technology, relying less on oil by diversifying exports and imports, enhancing cohesion in societies, improving the productivity of the national economy and building on Emirati values for the benefit of future generations. In Norway, the government viewed oil revenue not as a source for immediate squandering but as a “transformation of wealth, from a natural resource to financial wealth,” with consideration for the future by upholding an ethical obligation to share oil wealth with future generations. Nigeria is different For Nigeria, the narration is different. Policy missteps, wasteful spending and an inability to diversify away from petrol dollars or build a life after oil plan have restricted the country’s economy from attaining its full potential and have rendered it fully susceptible to the renowned “resource curse.” “No doubt, IOC divestments have created opportunities for local operators and service providers. However, weak governance eventually stifles everything. The government has a huge responsibility to catalyse things, drive efficiency, and sustain it so that the Nigerian oil and gas industry can thrive,” said Dimeji Bassir, CEO, Ofserv told Africa Energy Magazine. Despite producing oil in commercial quantities for more than five decades, Nigeria’s oil production has not exceeded, in recent tyimes, the 2.3 million barrels a day achieved in 1979. Its oil output was insufficient to spark a Middle Eastern-style economic miracle back then. “Since the early days of exploration in the Niger Delta region, Nigeria has faced challenges of crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism, leading to disruptions in production,” analysts at Asset & Resource Management Company Limited (ARM) Group said in their 2024 report. Read also: Nigeria’s oil sector turns ghost town as FDI vanishes They added, “These issues have significantly impacted Nigeria’s ability to produce crude oil to its maximum potential, resulting in consecutive contractions in the sector’s growth rate.” Recent modest gains such as the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), rising indigenous operators and the advent of modular refineries have been stunted by an inefficient national oil company, loss-making refineries, and declining foreign direct investment (FDI). “Nigeria’s refining capacity, although substantial, has been hindered by outdated infrastructure and mismanagement,” Analysts at ARM said. They added, “Recent efforts to establish modular refineries have increased refining capacity, but it still falls short of meeting domestic demand.” Rot in NNPC Analysts said deep scrutiny of Nigeria’s national oil company is the starting point in enabling the country’s oil and gas resources to deliver maximum value for its people. “Nigeria is a volatile country, and our oil and gas industry does not have a good reputation internationally, making it difficult to raise capital to develop greenfield projects. Refining is the newest of the different upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors in the country, and while dealing with being a pioneer, refineries in Nigeria have had great difficulties in securing feedstock,” said Michael Osime, chairman of AIPCC Energy. The NNPC, as the country’s oil firm, is at the centre of the chaos. Entrusted with 445,000 barrels of the country’s share of oil output from various contracts with local and international oil partners, the company has over the years turned to swapping crude for refined products because it could not maintain its refineries. When the company began the opaque oil swaps in 2010, its refineries were working at only around 20 percent of capacity. The next year, banks unwilling to finance more open account imports that were at a deficit of over $3 billion forced the government to start granting waivers to marketers, ushering in the era of fraudulent petrol subsidies. “By looking at successful oil companies like Shell and Exxon Mobil, Nigeria can glean valuable lessons in operational excellence. These companies prioritise efficiency, innovation, and sustainability, setting standards that NNPC and other local players should aspire to meet,” a senior oil executive told BusinessDay. He added, “For instance, embracing technology in exploration and production can lead to lower costs and reduced environmental impact, making Nigeria’s oil sector more sustainable in the long term,” Also requiring cleanup is NNPC operating models. It uses Joint Venture Agreements with local and international oil companies to produce in onshore and shallow-water oil wells. It owns 60 percent of benefits in these agreements but often fails to contribute its share of costs, leading to what is known as cash call arrears in the industry. However, it recently paid $2.44bn cash call obligations to multinational oil companies which are its joint-venture partners. Most of these fields are troubled by sabotage and local community issues, forcing its multinational partners to opt out. Under the Nigerian law, they are required to decommission these fields – essentially leaving them the way they met them environmentally – but the costs are enormous. So they found a creative solution by selling their stake to local oil companies. But NNPC has kicked against this arrangement. Shell, ExxonMobil and recently, ENI, have struggled to exit stakes in onshore assets. Read also: Nigeria pays $2.4bn cash call obligations to IOCs, others “If we examine the production figures, with about 1.3 million bpd, excluding 600,000 bpd from deepwater, we are left with only 700,000 bpd from onshore operations. This is a significant decline from the previous level of 2 million bpd,” Austin Avuru, executive chairman, A.A Holdings told Africa Energy 2024 report. He added, “As these IOC transactions settle and independents take charge, I anticipate a surge in new investments by these independent companies. It is conceivable that onshore and shallow water production could reach 4.5 million bpd, possibly in the near term.” Apart from upstream, analysts at ARM said Nigeria’s downstream sector faces challenges, including mispriced products, security concerns, and dilapidated infrastructure, despite being the 13th largest crude oil producer in the world. “The sector grapples with various challenges, including inadequate supply chain, security concerns around pipelines, inconsistent supply due to vandalism, outdated pipeline infrastructure, malfunctioning refineries, and logistics challenges,” Analysts at ARM said. The nation now has Dangote Petroleum Refinery and it is being looked upon to change the Nigerian petrol refining outlook.",

      "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — Military officials and analysts in the United States have for years warned of possible Chinese armed attacks or blockades on Taiwan, but a report released on Friday has raised a red flag about possible nonmilitary tactics that could be used effectively against the self-governed island.Beijing could wage an economic and cyber war to force Taiwan to surrender without directly using military power, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington, D.C.-based research institute, said in the report. Such a likely but overlooked scenario, it added, poses a challenge for the US, the island's biggest ally, and suggested that Washington make preparations for how best to respond.FDD researchers teamed up with banking and finance experts in Taiwan over two days earlier this year to simulate likely nonmilitary moves by Beijing, such as disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks on infrastructure. The exercise was the first of its kind and seeks to fill an analytical gap, the FDD said.\"Modern globalization has created more economic connections that China can exploit to achieve coercive aims,\" the report said. \"Technological innovation created even more digital connections, offering more possibilities for coercion, including through the targeting of critical infrastructure.\"Beijing has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary, although Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to make \"utmost efforts\" to do so peacefully. Taiwan split from the mainland in 1949 during a civil war when the defeated nationalist government fled to the island.Tensions have flared in the Taiwan Strait since 2016, when Beijing began to increase diplomatic and military pressure on the island, prompting the US to step up its support. Washington, which is obligated under US law to provide Taipei with sufficient military hardware for its defense, has argued that it is in America's interest to keep peace in the strait and to stand with democracies such as Taiwan to maintain the rules-based world order.Beijing has demanded the US to stay out of Taiwan, arguing it is a purely domestic affair.US President Joe Biden has indicated he would send troops to defend Taiwan in case of an armed attack by China, but the US government is yet to formulate a plan to respond to nonmilitary tactics, giving Beijing flexibility in working to undermine Taiwan without triggering an outright response from Washington that a military invasion would, the FDD researchers said.Taiwan's Foreign and Defense ministries had no immediate comment on the report.With an estimated 1 million Taiwanese living and working in China, economic ties have grown ever closer. That has made the possibility of economic coercion, boycotts and military blockades an even bigger threat.In the simulation exercises, the experts from the US and Taiwan studied possible moves by Beijing, such as conducting psychological wars to erode public trust, banning imports of Taiwanese products or raising tariffs on them, short-selling Taiwanese stocks, freezing bank transfers across the strait, cutting fiber optic cables, and targeting energy imports and storage.Recommendations include that Taiwan diversify its energy imports, relocate businesses away from the mainland, develop new markets, and build alliances and partnerships. The report suggested the US develop a playbook of options to counter China and improve coordination with allies.The Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance, which worked with the FDD on the simulation exercises, has argued that Taiwan must strengthen its financial resilience.\"China could destabilize Taiwan's financial system to incite social unrest as a precursor to invasion,\" the report said.Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Washington-based Global Taiwan Institute, said Beijing had already been ramping up nonmilitary measures against Taipei and that such efforts were expected to intensify in the coming months and years.\"It behooves the United States and Taiwan to work with allies and like-minded partners to strengthen our collective resilience to China's weaponization of economic interdependence,\" he said.

      "description": "WHEN it comes to managing different aspects of our lives, we often seek the help of professionals. Whether it's our health, education or legal matters, we trust experts to guide us with their knowledge and experience.When it comes to our finances, however, many of us choose to navigate this crucial area alone. Just as we wouldn't hesitate to consult a doctor for medical concerns or an architect to build our home, it's essential to recognize that managing finances effectively requires the expertise of a financial professional.This is where a financial planner comes into play. The architect builds your home, your teacher molds your mind, your lawyer gives legal advice, and your doctor takes care of your health.But who, then, takes care of your financial health?Each professional — the doctor, the lawyer, the teacher, the dentist and the architect — all have studied and trained in their field of specialization to provide for the specific needs of our society. They are professionals as they put the best interest of their clients — and patients — above themselves, unbiased in giving the best services and advice.While each of us has our own dealings with them, most of us leave just to ourselves the most intimate and important aspect of our lives — our money. If we put the care of our home, our body, our health and our lives in these professionals, shouldn't we also put the care of our finances to professionals?What architects are to houses, teachers to minds, lawyers to law, and doctors to physical health, financial planners are to financial health.Let us go back to the question earlier.Who, then, takes care of your financial health? The financial planner.The financial planner is the professional who \"provides sound, coordinated financial advice to individuals and their families.\" Money matters-wise, the financial planner would be your bet. The financial planner has studied and trained in personal finance, giving objective, unbiased advice and professional service to his clients. Having studied personal finance, the financial planner is knowledgeable in its different areas. Being unbiased, the financial planner rigorously seeks solutions and products in the market that would best achieve the client's financial objective — without preference or loyalty to any financial institution or product. And as a professional, the financial planner upholds and seeks the client's needs and best interest first, continuing to educate himself, thus improving his competence in personal finance.Everyone can study personal finance, but not everyone is a certified or registered financial planner. A professional financial planner is a part of a body of professionals giving studies, training and expertise in the field. Being certified means that the financial planner has undergone sufficient training, has the necessary knowledge, and upholds a code of ethics of the practice.When choosing your financial planner, ensure that s/he is certified with organizations of good repute.As the profession totally dedicated to your financial well-being, the financial planner gives you advice on the following specific areas: cash flow management, investment planning, insurance planning, tax and estate planning, education planning, and retirement planning.But is there really a need for a financial planner? Can't each person be responsible for his or her own finances? Yes, each person is responsible for his or her own finances. But there is a need for expert knowledge and advice on how he or she would do it.Imagine having a dedicated financial planner up-to-date with the latest economic trends and knowledge, able to steer your finances and investments through the rough sailing of economic up-tides and downturns, or design an insurance plan that would leave your family safe and secure should anything happen to you or someone who would help you craft, plan and realize your dream retirement lifestyle.Imagine, then, not having to worry about your finances at all. That is what a financial planner is all about. Too often, people go to the doctor in the midst of illness, just to find out it is too late or it could have been averted.Would we let this be the same with our finances?Just as we trust doctors to care for our health, lawyers to handle our legal affairs and teachers to guide our education, we should recognize the importance of entrusting our financial well-being to a professional. A financial planner provides the expertise, objectivity and dedication needed to help you navigate the complexities of personal finance, ensuring that you can meet your financial goals and secure a prosperous future. Don't wait until it's too late — start planning for your financial health today with the guidance of a trusted financial planner.Rienzie P. Biolena is a Registered Financial Planner of RFP Philippines. He is also a Chartered Wealth Advisor (CWA) and president of WealthArki and Consultancy, a financial planning firm.

      "description": "READERS' comments and reactions to my previous column, \"Uncanny guardians of public funds\" (The Manila Times, Sept. 29, 2024), deplore our politicians' hypocrisy. They spoke with disdain about the members of the House Committee on Good Government and Public Accountability, who took turns in saying their respective oratories about Congress' \"power of the purse\" and \"legislative and oversight functions.\" Netizens frown upon how these \"honorable members of the lower house\" flagged Vice President Sara Duterte into accounting for the Office of the Vice President's (OVP) disbursement of its funds as if these congressional representatives were \"holier than thou.\"We all strongly agree that the OVP must account for its disbursement of public funds, part of which was from the hard-earned money we were made to bleed through taxation. It's just a shame how the drama over that unfolded like the proverbial tale of the pot calling the kettle black.Our countrymen confess that they are already sick and tired of the breed of politicians we have today. Former senator Franklin Drilon, who rose to become the Senate president of the 11th, 12th, 13th and 16th Congress, said he was \"compelled to speak\" about the public's perception of the Senate. But while his issue is on the \"erosion of [the] chamber's credibility and prestige\" in the face of improper decorum of some of the incumbent senators while the Senate is in session, it nonetheless reflects the quality of the legislators we have today.Many readers of my column mourn the \"absence of choice;\" others lament that there are \"not enough good choices\" from those running for national and local positions come the midterm elections next year. The Senate slate of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration — whether running as independent or coalition candidates — mirrors this tragic reality. Same names, same faces, same political family lineage, all longtime politicos! \"Wala na bang iba? (Is there no one else)\" angry voters ask.Well, there are others.The Supreme Court has been very liberal with its ruling on who could run for public office. That a candidate is \"unknown,\" unmoneyed or incapable of launching a nationwide campaign (if the aspirant is running for a national position) is not sufficient grounds to disqualify him or her right away from seeking public office. And aside from citizenship, age, residency and literacy, the Constitution does not require other qualifications for any Filipino to be voted to an elective position.Political dynastyThe absence of choice is largely caused by political dynasties who, through many years of lording over electoral contests, have amassed great wealth, consolidated massive power and wielded strong influence over their constituents. They have deeply and securely entrenched themselves in their positions and power such that only a fool — or someone who has both the guts and the wherewithal to match the incumbent dynasts — would dare challenge these political kingpins. And by wherewithal, we mean more than a pittance (stash) of cash, but truckloads of it. In many cases throughout the country, it includes guns and goons, too!So, who are these \"trapos\" fooling when they declare that they were elected or reelected by their constituents because of their families' \"track record of good governance\"?To be fair, there might be those who got reelected up to a maximum number of terms because of their past performance. But once they tasted power, they got corrupted by it absolutely. They never want to let go of it anymore by gunning for another elective post. They let the spouse, or an offspring or sibling, run for the position they vacated, only to take over after the \"reliever\" completes a term.Public service?When one refers to real public service in a society like ours, where some 53.6 million live in poverty, devoted public servants who would look after the good of their constituents are likely to end up giving away what they have or are due them. Such that they become \"poorer,\" rather than richer, while in public office. Perhaps no quote about public service is better than that attributed to former United States president Harry S. Truman: \"You can't get rich in politics unless you're a crook.\"If senatorial candidates, for instance, would have to spend P245.35 million (as what one winning Senate candidate declared in 2022) to win a seat but stands to earn only P21.1 million in a six-year term, voters should wonder what could be behind the willingness to burn such an amount just to be a senator? And if those candidates have the money, where did it come from? Are they so rich to not want to recoup their expenses?Family business?Could it be the genuine desire to serve Batangueños that pushed former House lawmaker Vilma Santos-Recto to file her certificate of candidacy for governor after having served the province for three terms as its chief executive from June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2016?Was the desire to legislate laws that will benefit Batangas so ardent that her son Luis Manzano is seeking the post of vice governor and her son Ryan Recto as representative of the province's sixth district? If they all make it come election day, the mother will execute the laws that the sons will enact. But the sons may not be at ease in examining how the mother spends the budget that the legislative has enacted. With former senator Ralph Recto as finance secretary, it certainly is a happy family of public servants but an unlikely example of checks and balances in government.If current House members Erwin Tulfo and Camille Villar win their Senate bids, and Sen. Pia Cayetano wins another term, then we would have the Cayetano, Estrada, Tulfo and Villar siblings populating the Senate. We would have had two more pairs of happy family members in the chamber if Sen. Nancy Binay were not running for Makati City mayor and Sen. Cynthia Villar were not eyeing the mayor's seat in Las Piñas City. By May 30, both these legislators would have served two full terms in the Senate, barring them from seeking a third straight one.No wonder Congress does not want to pass the law that will implement the constitutional ban on political dynasties!A lot of people deem Philippine politics as a lucrative business because most of those who get elected to public office are rich. That is why Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra State in Nigeria, is on point when he said: \"No country can progress if its politics is more profitable than its industries. In a country where those in government are richer than entrepreneurs, they manufacture poverty.\"Since the politicians we elect are richer than our entrepreneurs, we know why our country remains poor.atty.edarevalo@gmail.comX: @atty_edarevalo",

      "content": "Former US president Donald Trump seems to have been seen to repeatedly emphasize the size of crowds at his events and boast about his media ratings for the past few months. The practice has raised eyebrows across the political spectrum. The Democratic Party seems to be making jokes over this obsession of Republican nominee Donald Trump, as per the Independent. Although he has claimed that nobody leaves his rallies at a recent event in town hall in Flint, Michigan, the attendees have been seen leaving his rally early, as per reports. Also Read : Law & Order: SVU streaming - When and where to watch new episodes of Season 26 The matter was raised by US vice president Kamala Harris during a presidential debate . She said that people are leaving the rallies of Donald Trump early because they are getting exhausted and bored. Former US president Donald Trump has also responded by saying that the rallies of Kamala Harris failed to pull crowds, as reported by the Independent. Washington Post has also interviewed some of the supporters of Republican nominee Donald Trump, who were seen departing from the rallies of the former US president. As per the Washington Post report, the key factors, which have forced the supporters to leave early, are the tardiness of Donald Trump, his long speeches and his rhetoric. Recently, at a rally in Las Vegas, a reporter witnessed more than 200 people leaving in the first 20 minutes.

      "description": "The time is now to ban the IRGC, or risk threatening our security, says Admiral Lord West",
      "content": "This week we saw what happens when your enemies are emboldened by overcaution. In April Iran launched an attack against Israel with more than 300 ballistic missiles, drones and cruise missiles. Israel was told to “bank the win”. But the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a fundamentalist wing of the Islamic Republic’s military, have come back for more. They have been disturbed by Israel ’s legitimate attacks on their terrorist proxies of Hamas and, most notably, Hezbollah, an aggressor who has fired almost 9,000 rockets at Israel since October 8 last year. To respond, the IRGC fired 180 missiles at Israel , hitting some military targets, and proudly claimed responsibility as retaliation for the death of terrorists. The IRGC is a malign influence in the Middle East and around the globe. For 41 years I served in the British Navy. Alongside our allies, we faced down threats as part of NATO bloc of countries locked in conflict with the Soviet Union. Since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, other enemies have come to the fore. I watched, during my years of service, as the ayatollahs took control of Iran and first began to terrorise their near-neighbours. They formed Hezbollah in Lebanon, a terrorist group with the express purpose of destroying the state of Israel . They also targeted our forces and allies in the Persian Gulf, even illegally seizing Royal Navy vessels and taking British sailors prisoner. Hezbollah was allowed to grow, and menace Israel with attack after attack, frequently from south of the Litani River, in flagrant breach of UN Resolution 1701 to demilitarise the area. Following Hamas’s devastating attack on Israel last year, Hezbollah joined the fray with renewed vigour from the north. More than 60,00 Israelis have been evacuated from towns near the northern border that are as a result currently uninhabitable. Hezbollah has been hit hard in recent weeks, but they remain a powerful terrorist organisation. Likely the strongest in the world. And crucially, behind Hezbollah’s power, is the IRGC which finances these terrorists. The IRGC is the world’s chief sponsor of terrorism. In the waters around Iran and the Gulf of Aden, crucial for the supply of goods and food to Europe, the IRGC threatens our shipping, either with their own navy or by bankrolling Houthi rebels in Yemen to fire rockets. The IRGC’s budget is £5billion annually - three times that of the regular Iranian armed forces. They are directly controlled by Iran’s religious leader Ali Khamenei. Their terrorist armies in the Middle East surround Israel and threaten its very existence. They seek to sow division on the streets of Britain or carry out attacks on Iranian dissidents across the globe. And they support our enemies against allies. Meanwhile, the regime continues to progress towards its stated aim of building a nuclear bomb, with Israel firmly in the ayatollahs’ cross-hairs. Last month we read reports that the Iranians had sent 200 ballistic missiles to Russia ’s Vladimir Putin , so they could bomb our friends in Ukraine . This comes after years of the IRGC supplying their attack and kamikaze drones to Putin’s army. As a favour in return, our Governments fear the Russians are sharing nuclear secrets with Iran. It’s clear, therefore, we are facing enemies who are coalescing together. But they have also made mistakes. Russia is bogged down in Ukraine , after we used our collective might with America in the lead, to stall their advance on Kyiv. This week, and earlier this year, we joined with partners to protect our ally Israel against huge rocket attacks from Iran. And so now we have an opportunity. An opportunity to apply pressure against the Iranian regime, which brutally suppresses its own people, and break the historic country of Iran away from this axis of autocracies, including China and Russia . To allow Russia and China to strengthen their Iranian attack dog, and even ensure the regime can build a nuclear bomb, will only store up far bigger troubles for us to face in the future. A nuclear Iran could leverage its power across the Middle East to protect its proxies with a nuclear umbrella, and increasingly threaten world order. It’s why we must seek to stop Iran in its tracks now. At the heart of the regime’s mission is the IRGC. It is, therefore, high time we proscribed this organisation, and designated them as terrorists, as have some of our closest allies in the US and Middle East. In opposition my party quite rightly supported the proscription, or ban, of the IRGC. This ban would allow us more tightly to control those groups in the UK which are linked to these sponsors of terror. And it will send a message, loud and clear, that the IRGC’s actions have consequences. That we won’t sit idly by and allow them to terrorise the world. I sincerely hope we don’t falter in the face of pressure, and that we follow through on this pledge to ban this organisation. Not to do so would threaten our security. It would show weakness. And weakness begets war. ● Lord West was First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff from 2002 to 2006 and Security Minister from 2007 to 2010.",

In Scotland, a police charge is a preliminary step before prosecutors decide whether to take the case to court. Murrell, who was chief executive of the SNP for 23 years, married former first minister Sturgeon in 2010 and has been arrested twice during the SNP finance investigation.

He said: “Once somebody is charged then they have the right to a trial within a reasonable time. “Before a person is formally charged, there might be an argument as to whether the clock is efficiently running. “There is absolutely no doubt that it is running in relation to Mr Murrell, so certainly the police and Crown Office have to be alive to that. “The police inquiry cannot go on indefinitely.” Police officers erected a tent outside Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell's home in 2023 (Image: PA) Pro-independence campaigner Sean Clerkin triggered the investigation in 2021 after raising concerns about more than £600,000 raised for a second referendum. Clerkin told Sky News he had received death threats, and urged that the probe be finished before the Scottish Parliament elections in 2026. He said: “All these years down the line I have been persecuted by nationalists on social media and at rallies, threatening to do me in, threatened to take me out. I have had death threats. “This case has to be wound up by the end of this year. In terms of the investigation, for us to have free and fair elections in 2026 without this hanging over any of the pro- independence parties.” An SNP spokesman said: “While the police investigation has reportedly been completed and passed over to the Crown Office, the case remains active and it would be inappropriate to comment.” READ MORE: Humza Yousaf hits back at anti-Semitism charge during march in London A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “A standard prosecution report has been received by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service from Police Scotland in relation to a 59-year-old man and incidents said to have occurred between 2016 and 2023. “Connected investigations of two other individuals, a man aged 72 and a 53-year-old woman, remain ongoing. “Professional prosecutors from COPFS and independent counsel will review this report. They will make decisions on the next steps without involving the Lord Advocate or Solicitor General. All Scotland’s prosecutors operate independently of political influence. “Before deciding what action to take, if any, in the public interest, prosecutors will consider if there is enough evidence. There must be evidence from at least two separate sources to establish that a crime was committed and that the person under investigation was the perpetrator. “This evaluation will involve a thorough examination of the numerous witness statements and extensive evidence collected by police. Prosecutors may instruct the police to conduct further investigations before taking a decision. “Decisions on how to proceed are taken by prosecutors acting independently, and are based upon available evidence, legal principles, and the merits of each case. They are not influenced by political events. “When making a decision, prosecutors will consider all the specific facts and circumstances of a case. The criteria for decision making and the range of options available to prosecutors are set out in the publicly available Prosecution Code.”",

The Limerick senator and Fine Gael Seanad Spokesperson on Finance considers it completely baffling that hospitals across the country continue to charge full parking fees to patients undergoing cancer treatments, with many offering no concessions whatsoever. “This practice must end,” the Limerick senator hit out. Senator Byrne said that “cancer patients already face immense challenges, and the last thing they should worry about is the financial burden of parking fees. “There is not only a significant disparity in the parking fees charged at different hospitals, but also in how easily patients can access information about available concessions.”",

      "description": "'The history of cinema is littered with amazing films that during their release were seen as critical and box office flop'",
      "content": "Article content Even before it landed in theatres with a giant thud last weekend, Francis Ford Coppola’s sci-fi epic Megalopolis had all the makings for a box office bomb. Coppola’s costly passion project centres on Cesar (Adam Driver), a visionary architect who battles his nemesis, Mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), in a bid to create a more idealistic future for their mythic city. After dreaming about the film for decades, the 85-year-old Godfather and Apocalypse Now director ended up independently financing the feature for $120 million by selling a stake in his Napa Valley wine empire. But critics were lukewarm after its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May. Major s tudios and streaming services passed on distributing it and it was only after Lionsgate hopped onboard that it got a theatrical release. To try and drum up interest, Coppola had to again open his wallet to market the movie. On Rotten Tomatoes , the film was savaged by critics and audiences alike with a certified rotten rating of 35%. Vanity Fair said it was “a passion project gone horribly wrong ” calling the finished product “tedious nonsense ... stuffed with poorly elucidated ideas.” When it played at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, more ink was spilled over its premiere party at Estiatorio Milos than on the actual film itself. Despite his assertions that he wasn’t concerned about the film’s box office gross (“I couldn’t be more blessed,” Coppola told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the film’s release), Megalopolis’ $4 million debut likely left a bruise on the five-time Oscar winner whose previous directorial effort, 2011’s Twixt , was also summarily dismissed. Industry analyst Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations tells Postmedia he isn’t surprised Coppola’s visionary experiment failed to garner interest because there was already a well-established pattern of declining interest in “arthouse” fare. The fact that Coppola had to self-finance the film “ should have been the ultimate red flag for the director,” Bock thinks. “You only have to look at the declining indie market to see Megalopolis was a massive gamble,” Bock says. “Even a more straight forward, classic narrative like Damien Chazelle’s Babylon , which starred Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie and had a very arthouse feel, failed to connect with audiences.” With Megalopolis’ earliest scripts dating back to the ’70s, Bock thinks Coppola should have delayed the film a few more years to tell the story using AI. “Maybe then he could have made it for $5 million,” he says. As Joker: Folie a Deux reigns supreme with audiences this weekend, Megalopolis will tumble into further obscurity. And it’s not the first time Coppola has wrestled with failure. I n 1982, he plunged his production company Zoetrope into bankruptcy to make the little-seen musical-romance One From the Heart . But his bold, swing-for-the-fences mentality is what guided him his whole career. “Everyone’s so worried about money. I say: Give me less money and give me more friends,” Coppola said in his chat with the AP . “Friends are valuable. Money is very fragile. You could have a million marks in Germany at the end of World War II and you wouldn’t be able to buy a loaf of bread.” In a 2020 interview with Postmedia , Coppola said that he always tried to tackle different subjects throughout his career, which began in the early 1960s. “I took a lot of chances with my choices. Some I won with, but many I lost with,” he said at the time. “There are many goals in life. You can wish to be rich or famous, but after a while, you learn that the greatest pleasure of all is to be a man who has a sense of knowledge about life.” Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore , said even though audiences didn’t turn out on opening weekend, movie fans should be celebrating Coppola for taking a gamble and trying to do something different. “Coppola’s legacy is assured no matter what and to have the audaciousness to take his own money and risk everything at this late stage in his storied career should be an inspiration to all and a lesson in how to be fearless in the singular pursuit of your artistic vision,” Dergarabedian says. “He took a big swing and whiffed at the box office, but perhaps it fulfilled him creatively,” Bock adds. “If that’s the case, then it’s money well spent.” The discourse on Megalopolis’ paltry ticket sales and D+ CinemaScore is also missing the larger storyline, Dergarabedian explains. “As movie fans, we should appreciate the effort to greenlight movies not based on a profit and loss statement, but the potential that an interesting — if not great movie — can be seen on the big screen,” he says. The disappointing number for Megalopolis mirrors the flop writer-director-producer-star Kevin Costner experienced earlier this year with Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 1 , the first instalment of a proposed four-film Western series he began developing in the late 1980s and funneled $38 million of his own money into. Costner was unbowed by the collapse, telling Entertainment Weekly in an interview published the day Horizon released into theatres that he was “happy” with the finished product. “I’ve lived with movies and what happens to them on their opening weekend,” he said. “If we put so much pressure on that, we’re bound to be disappointed.” Still, after grossing $36 million at the worldwide box office, Costner’s Horizon: Chapter 2 saw its August release pushed off indefinitely. Together, the two completed films might end up costing Costner millions. But he said he still intends to direct a third instalment in the series . “I have to hurry and not let the rock fall back downhill. I’ve gotta go put my hands on it again and start to push it up,” he said at the Venice Film Festival last month. “It’s a rope that I cannot let go of.” Maybe for Hollywood to survive the late-career gambles taken by Coppola and Costner are exactly the kind of risk storytellers need to take. Not every film is going to be a Marvel-sized hit. But for the artform to survive amidst competition from YouTube, TikTok and a never-ending slate of streaming titles, moviemakers will have to deliver a cinematic experience that is unique and wholly different. Audiences of the future may come to view Megalopolis in a new light. “The history of cinema is littered with amazing films that during their release were seen as critical and box office flops,” Dergarabedian says. “Some of those are now recognized as important and notable; perhaps someday Megalopolis can join the ranks of those reevaluated films.” When we spoke four years ago, Coppola’s mind certainly was on the cinema of the future. “ I can’t say what’s coming next for the cinema, but I do know that the movies that your grandchildren will make will be beautiful and unlike anything I can imagine,” he said. “That fills me with a joy.” mdaniell@postmedia.com",

      "description": "The crypto market is heating up, with XRP showing a notable 23% increase since early September. However, future gains may be uncertain as looming regulations could present new challenges. Simultaneously, ChainLink whales are making waves, conducting large transactions, and positioning them as coins to watch.Meanwhile, BlockDAG has taken center stage, with its presale reaching a whopping $84.2 million after raising $3 million in just 24 hours. This record-breaking performance is drawing the attention of whales and buyers alike. Adding to its appeal, BlockDAG has launched a $1 million giveaway, generating further buzz and increasing participation in the BlockDAG Network.XRP Price Outlook: Could a 25% Decline Be Coming?Since September 6, XRP has experienced a solid 23% recovery, positioning its price at $0.618. However, critical analysis highlights a resistance level at $0.639, which has capped gains for the past seven months. This could signal a potential downturn if XRP fails to break through.The possibility of an SEC appeal also looms, casting doubt on future price movements. If XRP cannot surpass the $0.639 threshold, analysts warn of a possible correction, with projections indicating a potential 25% decline in value.ChainLink Whale Activity Picks UpChainLink whales have made a noticeable return, with a significant uptick in transactions over $100,000. The number of large transactions doubled overnight, jumping from 65 to 130.Additionally, daily activity on ChainLink’s network indicates broader engagement. Not only did the frequency of transactions rise, but the volume also surged, from 1.86 million to 7.28 million LINK tokens. This sharp increase in whale activity highlights a renewed interest in ChainLink, drawing attention from market watchers.BlockDAG’s $3M Fundraising Amidst $1M GiveawayBlockDAG continues to gain momentum, with its presale raising an additional $3 million in just 24 hours, bringing the total to over $84.2 million.

The rapid growth is further fueled by BlockDAG’s engagement in the crypto community through partnerships and giveaways.Currently, BlockDAG is running its second $1 million giveaway, which has drawn massive interest. To participate, individuals must hold at least $100 in BDAG coins, follow BlockDAG on social media, share the giveaway post, and encourage others to join.Beyond the excitement of the giveaway, purchasing BDAG coins offers significant potential for growth. Since the presale’s launch, BDAG’s price has skyrocketed from $0.001 to $0.0192 in its 23rd batch, representing an astounding 1820% ROI. With over 13.6 billion coins already sold, market projections indicate BDAG could reach $20 by 2027. Whether through the giveaway or strategic buying, acquiring BDAG now presents a strong opportunity for future gains in a rapidly growing market.The Crypto Craze ContinuesThe fluctuating outlook for XRP and the resurgence of ChainLink whales paint a picture of an evolving market with unpredictable potentials. Amidst these movements, BlockDAG stands out as a major player, having raised $3 million in just 24 hours, pushing its presale total to over $84.2 million.With BlockDAG’s $1 million giveaways and its record-breaking presale, this isn’t just a fleeting trend—it signals a golden opportunity for buyers.

      "content": "The crypto market is undergoing significant changes, with Shiba Inu’s future looking optimistic due to a potential market recovery following substantial price shifts this year. Simultaneously, Binance Coin (BNB) is encountering hurdles as emerging bearish trends could lead to a decline in its market position. Amid these developments, BlockDAG has emerged as a powerhouse in the presale cryptocurrency space, amassing an impressive $84.2 million. The recent surge includes a noteworthy increase of $5 million within a 48-hour window, highlighting the project’s growing appeal among crypto enthusiasts. BlockDAG has also introduced a limited-time offer, a 50% bonus for buyers until October 14. This incentive has not only drawn significant attention from the community but has positioned BlockDAG as a formidable entity in the crypto space. What you'll learn 👉 Predicting Shiba Inu: A Look at Market Trends BNB’s Uncertain Future-What’s Ahead? BlockDAG’s Rapid Growth: $3M Raised in 24 Hours & 50% Bonus Offer Summing Up! Predicting Shiba Inu: A Look at Market Trends Shiba Inu’s market analysis suggests a rebound might be in the works after a dramatic 300% value increase earlier this year. Although the price later dropped by about 70%, recent trends indicate a possible resurgence as the coin begins to recover some of its previous losses. Recent technical indicators provide a hopeful outlook for Shiba Inu, showing a break from a longstanding downward trend, which suggests a potential upward movement. This could bring relief to holders, bolstering confidence in a sustained increase above key resistance levels. BNB’s Uncertain Future-What’s Ahead? Recent reviews suggest potential challenges for Binance Coin (BNB), with bearish patterns indicating a possible price drop. Notably, a triple-top formation in the daily charts, accompanied by an evening star candlestick pattern near the $605 level, points to a shift from an upward to a downward trend. These technical indicators, along with unfavorable on-chain data, hint at an impending downturn for BNB. As a result, an increasing number of traders are preparing for potential declines, reflecting a cautious approach in response to these warning signs. This growing concern among traders emphasizes the need for vigilance in monitoring BNB’s market movements. BlockDAG’s Rapid Growth: $3M Raised in 24 Hours & 50% Bonus Offer As September ends, BlockDAG has launched a striking promotion that’s grabbing the crypto market’s attention. The project is offering a substantial 50% bonus on BDAG coin purchases using the promo code BDAG50. This well-timed offer aligns with the successful launch of BlockDAG’s testnet and the upcoming release of its mainnet, highlighting significant advancements to both its platform and website. With these updates, the BlockDAG presale has gained incredible momentum. Over the last few days, the presale has impressively raised $5 million—$2 million on one day followed by an additional $3 million the next. This boost has increased the total presale amount to over $84.2 million. Market analysts are closely watching BlockDAG as it edges closer to the $100 million mark and may reach its $600 million Hard Cap in the upcoming months. This fundraising spike is largely thanks to BlockDAG’s aggressive strategies. The 50% bonus has dramatically increased BDAG coin sales. Coin buyers are eagerly participating in batch 23, pushing total sales to an astonishing 13.3 billion coins and increasing the presale amount to $84.2 million, setting a record for the largest presale in cryptocurrency history. Experts are encouraging even occasional buyers to consider participating, with forecasts indicating that BDAG coin values could climb to $20 by 2027. Given the remarkable 1820% ROI since batch 1, getting in BlockDAG now appears to be a smart decision, particularly as it shows immense potential for rapid growth in the near future. Summing Up! As forecasts suggest a possible upswing for Shiba Inu and as BNB shows signs of a slump, cryptocurrency heavyweights are keenly buying BlockDAG, taking advantage of its temporary 50% bonus offer. This strategy led to a dramatic $3 million increase in presale funds within just one day, prompting market experts to predict a bullish future. This calculated move not only enhances their asset base but also strategically positions them for the anticipated growth in the cryptocurrency sector. With BDAG’s sales reaching unprecedented levels, BlockDAG is emerging as the cryptocurrency likely to skyrocket. Consequently, this presents an ideal time to consider BlockDAG’s potential, as it holds the promise of significant long-term gains.

      "content": "Altseason is expected to begin in Q4, with altcoins set to outperform Bitcoin soon. Chart trends show strong support levels, with resistance around the $12-$14 trillion range. Historical data suggests altcoins may soon outperform Bitcoin as investor focus shifts. The crypto experts believe that the long-anticipated ‘Altseason’ is expected to begin in the last quarter of this year. This time is generally characterized by the rising performance of ‘altcoins’, or the alternative cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin. Two of the analysts in the crypto space, Elja and Crypto Rover, have weighed in, creating further anticipation. #Altseason will start in Q4 That's the tweet. pic.twitter.com/JW1EoDLdQd Crypto analyst Elja has shared a chart that indicates that Altseason can begin in Q4. The chart illustrated the key trends and indicators that suggest an increase in altcoins’ prices. Crypto Rover, another analyst, also endorsed this prediction. Using historical data, he predicted that Altseason could start in the next 42 days at most. These insights have generated more attention from the traders and the investors. According to historical data, #Altseason should start in 42 days... The chart shared by Elja highlights several significant market movements. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies other than the top 10 most dominant assets also display an upward trajectory within an ascending channel. This channel has been tested at the lower end many times which indicates that it is a strong support level of the market. These touches show periods of lows that are usually followed by bullish runs. The chart also shows areas of resistance, particularly around the $12-$14 trillion market cap range. This resistance zone could act as a critical barrier to further price increases. However, if the market breaks through this resistance, the next target could be around $26 trillion, as indicated by a yellow flag in the upper range of the channel. These predictions are also supported by historical data of previous cycles. Altseason is usually achieved after bitcoin consolidates or loses dominance . As Bitcoin price becomes stable, then investors transit to altcoins, thereby making the prices of altcoins rise. This change is yet to occur but with the market support remaining strong and the resistance levels being tested, the environment appears right for altcoins to rise in the near future.",

      "content": "The presale scene has witnessed a seismic shift with BlockDAG’s recent surge, scooping up $3 million within the initial 24 hours. The crypto community is abuzz as Chainlink (LINK) displays strong market potential, potentially increasing by 20% if it maintains a foothold above $13.10. Simultaneously, Litecoin (LTC) has seen a robust 15% ascent after surpassing significant resistance levels, igniting discussions about an impending rally. The standout, however, remains BlockDAG, which has attracted substantial attention from crypto whales during its limited-time 50% bonus offering, set to conclude on October 14. This golden opportunity to augment BDAG holdings precedes the highly anticipated overhaul of BlockDAG’s website and platform, signaling its aspirations to cement a formidable market presence. Enthusiasts and traders are eagerly capitalizing on this fleeting chance to enhance their portfolios. Chainlink’s Market Outlook: A Surge on the Horizon Chainlink is poised for a possible 20% ascension, having breached a bullish double-bottom pattern, signaling an optimistic trajectory if it remains above $13.10. Despite a buoyant market atmosphere and favorable Long/Short ratios and funding rates, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a potential downturn, suggesting some turbulence ahead. Furthermore, a noticeable 25% dip in LINK’s trading volume could imply a temporary slowdown in market participation. Currently, LINK’s price hovers at $12.65, marking a 1.2% increase over the past day. Traders are advised to monitor the pivotal $12.12 and $13.16 levels closely, as these thresholds could trigger significant liquidations, potentially disrupting the upward momentum. BlockDAG’s 50% Bonus Offer Enters Final Days! BlockDAG has set the crypto market alight with its advanced technology and a blockbuster presale, consistently breaking records and recently surpassing $3 million in sales within a single day. This impressive momentum is fueled by robust network fundamentals and an exclusive 50% bonus offer, which is drawing to a close on October 14. As BlockDAG gears up to unveil its revamped website and platform, the timing couldn’t be better for enthusiasts to get involved. With over $84.2 million raised from the sale of more than 13.6 billion coins, there’s a palpable excitement among traders aiming to maximize this bonus. This surge in participation is bolstering confidence in the network’s potential, with projections suggesting that the coin’s value could reach $1 by 2025. The enthusiasm is tangible, especially for early supporters who have already realized a staggering 1820% return since the initial batches. BlockDAG now boasts a community of over 140,000 unique traders, all buzzing with anticipation as the deadline for the bonus offer nears. The community is poised to welcome new members who wish to capitalize on this unique opportunity before the bonus period expires. Those acting swiftly are positioned to significantly amplify their holdings and enjoy the rewards of this thriving network. Litecoin News: Anticipation of a Major Rally Litecoin has recently seen a significant upturn, climbing over 15% after breaking through major resistance levels. This movement has ignited a wave of excitement among Litecoin holders, fueling speculation about the onset of a larger rally. While some skeptics remain cautious, citing Litecoin’s past struggles to consistently break the $100 mark and its 80% decrease from its peak of $400, the recent price increase offers a glimmer of hope. Historically, Litecoin has hovered between $60 and $68, lagging while other altcoins advanced. However, the latest price movement has injected optimism into the community, raising the possibility that Litecoin could finally overcome its previous highs. The crypto community is watching eagerly, anticipating whether this could signal the start of a substantial comeback for Litecoin. Leading the Charge in the Next Crypto Bull Run? The crypto landscape is vibrant with potential, presenting significant opportunities for traders in anticipation of the next bull market. Chainlink (LINK) is on track for a potential 20% rise in value, and Litecoin (LTC) has already experienced a 15% surge, reigniting enthusiasm for its future prospects. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues to attract substantial attention with over $3 million worth of BDAG coins sold as its lucrative 50% bonus offer nears its conclusion. As the presale escalates beyond $84.2 million with 13.4 billion coins sold, forecasts indicate BlockDAG’s value could hit $1 by 2025. With such predictions, the current period stands as a crucial moment for traders to seize these burgeoning opportunities before they pass.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. After a long slump, memecoins like Pepe and Dogecoin are rallying again, while new player Cutoshi joins the scene. After a long, gloomy stretch in the crypto market, things are finally starting to brighten up! Meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are back in the news, showing off impressive breakout rallies that have investors wondering what’s next. As the hype around these tokens starts to fade, a new player is crashing the party: Cutoshi (CUTO). This shiny new memecoin brings a fresh twist to decentralized finance, making it a golden chance for anyone who slept on Pepe and Dogecoin. Pepe in a bullish rally, time to book profits? Pepe scored a solid 24% gain in just a month. It only took two weeks for the excitement to really take off, with gains flying over 7%. However, Pepe’s current price is still 48% off its all-time high, leaving some investors wondering if they should cash out now. Nearly 70% of holders are in the green, but as more people mull over cashing out, we could see selling pressure start to creep up. Although Pepe set the memecoin world ablaze with talk of huge Q4 gains, the bullish vibes hit a snag as short holders began to bail. As October rolls around, Pepe seems to be losing its momentum, leaving many anxious. Will October bring any good news for DOGE holders? Dogecoin has kept everyone guessing, swinging through a mix of highs and lows in September. Even though it managed to climb nearly 12% for the month, investors are starting to lose interest as its price swings get wilder. Right now, 73% of Dogecoin holders are still sitting pretty...",

      "description": "The post Polymarket Weighs In on Possible Satoshi Nakamoto Identities Ahead of Upcoming HBO Doc – Here’s the Top Pick appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Gamblers on crypto betting platform Polymarket are weighing in on the possible identity of pseudonymous Bitcoin (BTC) creator Satoshi Nakamoto before a new HBO documentary reveals his true name. According to data from the Polygon (POL)-based platform, the overwhelming majority of bettors believe the documentary will reveal deceased American cryptographer Len Sassaman, known for his work on the Mixmaster anonymous retailer, as the creator of BTC. The statistics show that 51.5% of those placing bets believe Sassaman created the flagship digital asset over a decade ago. In second place is deceased American software developer Hal Finney at 10.8% while Adam Back, the chief executive of blockchain firm Blockstream, comes in third place with 7.7%. Others under consideration include computer scientist and legal scholar Nick Szabo, former programmer and crime boss Paul Le Roux, and Australian businessman Craig Wright, who once publicly declared to be Satoshi. However, despite the documentary being scheduled to launch on October 8th, Polymarket data shows that 80% of bettors don’t think the true identity of Satoshi will be revealed in 2024. In 2021, a theory appeared that named Sassaman as Satoshi. According to its author, the evidence lines up as Satoshi sent his final communication just a couple of months before Sassaman’s death on July 3rd, 2011. Furthermore, Sassaman was an expert in the cryptography that makes up Bitcoin’s infrastructure and he was on the task force that created the TCP/IP protocol, the foundation of both the internet and BTC’s protocol. The author also notes that Sassaman worked closely with Finney, who was said to be the first person to ever receive BTC. Earlier this week, filmmaker Cullen Hoback, best known for his QAnon-focused documentary miniseries “Q: Into the Storm,” released a trailer for his new BTC documentary, “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery,” which is slated to reveal the identity...",

      "content": "BlockDAG’s presale has set a new benchmark in the crypto world by amassing over $3 million within a single day, marking one of the most successful presales to date. This surge is propelled by the involvement of major crypto enthusiasts, particularly noted for their holdings in Chainlink and Litecoin, who have been significantly active. The presale’s success coincides with a limited-time offer—a 50% bonus on BDAG tokens, available until October 14. This opportune moment aligns with the upcoming release of BlockDAG’s redesigned website and platform, signaling the project’s readiness to establish a prominent presence in the cryptocurrency market. The crypto community is taking quick action to leverage the benefits of the bonus offer as anticipation builds for the new developments that BlockDAG is set to unveil. Optimistic Forecasts for Chainlink The market sentiment for Chainlink (LINK) is particularly buoyant as it shows potential for a notable price increase of up to 20% if it maintains stability above $13.10. Currently trading at approximately $12.65, LINK has exhibited a slight increase of 1.2% over the last 24 hours. Despite the promising setup, indicated by a favorable Long/Short ratio and funding rate, caution is advised. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a mild downtrend, suggesting that not all market conditions are favorable. Moreover, there has been a 25% decrease in LINK’s trading volume, suggesting a potential slowdown in market participation at this time. Traders are encouraged to monitor critical thresholds at $12.12 and $13.16, where significant market movements, such as liquidations, may occur and potentially impact the asset’s price trajectory. BlockDAG’s 50% Bonus Offer Nearing Conclusion! BlockDAG is currently experiencing a meteoric rise in its presale endeavors, consistently breaking records with the most recent achievement of raising over $3 million in just one day. This remarkable success is supported by strong fundamentals and an enticing 50% bonus offer, which is slated to conclude on October 14. This makes the present moment a pivotal one for participants seeking to enhance their BDAG holdings substantially. With the imminent launch of a redesigned website and platform, BlockDAG is distinguishing itself as a formidable entity in the cryptocurrency sector. As the presale tally surpasses $84.2 million with the sale of over 13.4 billion coins, there is a notable increase in activity from traders eager to maximize the benefits of the bonus offer. This fervor is reinforcing the optimism surrounding the coin’s potential ascent to $1 by 2025. For early supporters, the journey has been especially rewarding, with a staggering 1820% return observed since the initial batches. With the coin price at $0.0192 in batch 23, the momentum is palpable within BlockDAG’s community of over 140,000 unique traders. As the deadline for the promotional offer draws near, the anticipation and energy within the community continue to build. Those participating now are poised to substantially benefit from their association with BlockDAG, positioning themselves advantageously for future developments. Litecoin Sees Resurgence Amid Market Optimism In related news, Litecoin has captured headlines with a robust recovery, achieving a 15% increase after surpassing crucial resistance levels. This resurgence has sparked considerable enthusiasm among Litecoin holders, fueling speculations of an impending larger rally. Despite this optimism, some remain cautious given Litecoin’s recent struggles to consistently exceed the $100 mark, with its value still significantly below its all-time high of $400. Historically confined within the $60 to $68 range, this recent upward movement offers a glimmer of hope for Litecoin potentially breaking free from previous limitations. The crypto community remains vigilant, watching to see if this marks the beginning of a substantial recovery for Litecoin. Is the Crypto Market Poised for a Bull Run? The crypto landscape is buzzing with significant activities as major developments unfold across various cryptocurrencies. Chainlink is anticipated to potentially increase by 20% in price, while Litecoin enjoys renewed vigor with its recent 15% rise. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is attracting considerable attention with more than $3 million worth of BDAG coins acquired as its 50% bonus offer approaches its expiration. With the presale now exceeding $84.2 million and 13.4 billion coins sold, the enthusiasm for BlockDAG’s future is stronger than ever. Market analysts suggest that the timing is optimal for participants to engage with BlockDAG, as it gears up for significant milestones expected by 2025. Participants are encouraged to stay informed and consider participating in these timely opportunities before they conclude.

On Oct. 4, the EigenLayer team announced they were investigating an “unapproved selling activity” concerning a wallet ending in “f10D.” This wallet address sold about 1.6 million of EigenLayer’s EIGEN tokens, valued at approximately $5.7 million. Following EigenLayer’s announcement, Etherscan quickly marked the address as under investigation. On Oct. 5, EigenLayer released a community update stating that the unapproved token-selling incident was the result of a hack. The team reported that a malicious attacker compromised an email thread involving an investor’s token transfer into custody. Due to this attack, the investor’s 1.6 million tokens were transferred to the attacker. EigenLayer explained: “The attacker sold these stolen EIGEN tokens via a decentralized swap platform and transferred stablecoins to centralized exchanges.” Meanwhile, the protocol indicated that they have already communicated with the relevant platforms and authorities. “We are in contact with these platforms and law enforcement. A portion of the funds have already been frozen,” EigenLayer added. While the tokens were stolen through a hack, the EigenLayer team reassured the community that the incident was isolated and did not impact its broader ecosystem. The team clarified that the compromise was not related to any onchain functionality and stated there is no known vulnerability in the protocol or token contracts. EigenLayer also mentioned in the community update that they would continue their investigation and provide updates as more information becomes available. On Oct. 1, the EIGEN token was unlocked. Following this, it traded at $3.85 on Binance, giving it a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of about $6.5 billion. According to data aggregator CoinMarketCap, this valuation placed the token at the 94th spot by market capitalization. As of Oct. 5, the coin information website indicated that EIGEN trades at around $3.38, placing its FDV at $5.6 billion and ranking it at the 99th position in the overall crypto market capitalization rankings.",

This aim is a uniquely different pattern within the cryptocurrency sector as Rexas makes this possible through its comprehensive ecosystem such as Rexas Estate, Rexas Launchpad, and Rexas Token Builders amongst many others. Beyond owning and accessing real-world properties fractionally, Rexas Finance through its comprehensive ecosystem makes it possible for the regular people to be investors in its token without stress. These offers as well as the ongoing giveaway session of $1 million to 20 of its community that are gotten from Rexas early investors enhance the market traffic on Rexas making it a token of interest for whales. Moving on, Rexas Finance’s whales have been buying RXS as their belief in the prospect of this token being very worthwhile especially as this service will open property investment to all in the entire world. All these movements reflect the advantages of blockchain technology in the field of investment. Ripple (XRP) As the focus turns four-way, the increasing whales’ activity for XRP presently trading at dollar 0.62 encourages one to believe in risks associated with the decided trend. Ripple is associated with the workings of cross-border payments and therefore one shall not be astonished that the XRP Ledger supports prompt and relatively inexpensive transactions, hence preferred by banks and other prototypes. After the win over the SEC with the lawsuit in the year 2023, investors were buoyed up with confidence in the company, and subsequent developments in allowing around the network have been aimed at improving the network further. Moreover, the efforts of Ripple in establishing partnerships with well-known global financial institutions prove the idea that the company can potentially change the way currency is transferred across the world. Taking into consideration the fact that Ripple provides options for greater privacy, conducting these operations will help achieve cross-border marrying financial systems. The strategic goal of the company is broadening the range of its applications and encoding new technologies so that Ripple will not lose its leadership in this field of development. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) has registered interest from whales especially as the crypto market goes green with the price standing at $2.28. As a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, this young coin fits into speculative trading as it relies on the vicinity and social media craze rather than the product itself. The latest uptrend in whale accumulation is seen through such transactions as a whale who bought 1.49 million WIF tokens at $1.34 million. This surge is driven by Dogwifhat’s market niche which comes from the fact that it is a fad and one that is surrounded by the drawing of Westerns towards the trade of meme coins. Moreover, due to the nature of the coin having a volatile price nature, there is a high chance of making profits which creates interest in big players engaging in buying and selling on a short phenotypic trait’s price. As the market turns bullish, the whales are loading on WIF, positioning themselves for appreciation in price as well as exploiting the coin’s community for appreciation. This particularly interesting perspective highlights the overall ‘Psychological Characteristics of Investors’ behavior towards meme coins when the market turns bullish. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Pepe Coin’s (PEPE) price has witnessed an increase in whale interest as the crypto market gains the green with the current price standing at $0.00001115. The meme coin which is focused on frogs has, however, attracted a lot of whales owing to the high liquidity and earning potential the meme is associated to. It has been reported that whales were Investors were on the net purchasing PEPE because of its increasing market value including a profit of 400% for its whales too. The traction of the coin is extended by social networking, and the meme coins outpace the performance of the well-known Doge and Shiba Inu coins. In addition, the volumes of trade in PEPE have increased and reached billions turnover during a day, which proves the active interest of investors. Conclusion As the crypto market turns green, Ripple (XRP), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Pepe Coin (PEPE) are experiencing heightened whale interest, reflecting their unique value propositions and community dynamics. However, it is Rexas Finance (RXS) that ultimately stands out, with its innovative approach to democratizing real estate investment through blockchain technology.

Atlanta resident Marina Camplone says someone pretending to be a Chase fraud representative called her phone using the same number shown on the back of her debit card, reports the ABC-affiliated WSB-TV. Camplone says she was tricked into giving the criminal access to her account, but realized what was happening in real time and raced to a local Chase branch. A teller said her money was being sent to an account at Wells Fargo, wrote account information on a Post-it and told her to run to a Wells Fargo branch across the street. But the runaround was in vain and Wells Fargo has not returned the funds. Says Wells Fargo in a statement, “When we identify or are alerted to fraudulent activity, we take action. We have a thorough process to investigate all reports of account fraud and scams.” Meanwhile, Chase says it will not reimburse Camplone, blaming her for falling victim to the scam. “Our customer fell victim to a scam. Consumers should always be suspicious of people asking them to send money to prevent fraud. Banks won’t make these requests, but scammers will.” The financial giant also warns against spoofing, where criminals mimic the numbers used by Chase or other banks. Camplone says it would have been better if she kept her money at home. “I feel like I should have had it at home in an envelope somewhere in a box under the mattress.” Don’t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are...",

      "description": "The post Bitcoin Struggles at $62K Resistance Level appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Bitcoin is currently encountering significant resistance near the $62,200 mark, heightening the possibility of a swift price reversal. This situation may prolong the cryptocurrency’s consolidation phase, which has persisted for seven months. Despite this fluctuating price behavior, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains optimistic. What is Bitcoin’s Current Price Status? As of Friday, Bitcoin recorded a 2.20% rise, reaching the $62,000 threshold. The weekend typically sees reduced market liquidity, suggesting that traders should anticipate heightened volatility within the cryptocurrency landscape. Why Does BlackRock Value Bitcoin as a Hedge? At the 2024 Digital Assets Conference in Brazil, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, underscored Bitcoin’s potential as a safeguard against the depreciating value of the US dollar. They highlighted that the dollar’s purchasing power has plummeted drastically since 1913. “Bitcoin stands out as a global financial alternative due to its fixed supply, decentralized management, and low transaction and storage costs.” – BlackRock Recent price charts indicate that Bitcoin may be experiencing a trend shift, characterized by increasingly higher lows and peaks established in September. Should Bitcoin break past the $65,500 barrier, a potential rise toward $70,000 could follow. The daily analysis shows that buyers are pushing to re-enter the resistance zone between $63,900 and $65,000, and overcoming this level might enable Bitcoin to achieve new record highs. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.3 trillion, still small compared to assets like gold and US bonds. It is increasingly regarded as a hedge against inflation, countering the diminishing purchasing power of the US dollar. Short-term price drops could occur if Bitcoin fails to break through the $65,000 resistance level. The overall sentiment around Bitcoin remains positive, with experts asserting its growing significance as a store of value in today’s economic climate, making it a viable option for portfolio diversification.

Optimism introduces the ICrosschainERC20 interface for better interoperability between L2s. Buterin emphasizes the need for wallet-level standardization and native interoperability for rare ERC20s and NFTs. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin weighed in on an ongoing discussion about cross-chain compatibility in the Ethereum ecosystem. His comments came in response to a new technical update shared on Optimism’s GitHub, which introduced the ICrosschainERC20 interface, designed to enable better interoperability between different Layer 2 (L2) networks. This update aimed to improve the user experience by enabling neutral minting and burning functions thereby simplifying asset transfers between L2s. The development is part of a broader effort to unify Ethereum infrastructure across various chains. Buterin expressed optimism about the level of cooperation within the Ethereum community, stating, “I think people are sleeping on just how much Ethereum infrastructure players really are willing to cooperate and build a unified Ethereum ecosystem.” Seen on @Optimism github: “Also introducing ICrosschainERC20 interface... to be cross-chain neutral and extensible to other L2s” I think people are sleeping on just how much Ethereum infrastructure players really *are* willing to cooperate and build a unified Ethereum ecosystem pic.twitter.com/Itm2617z57 — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 5, 2024 This cross-chain neutrality is particularly relevant for assets like ERC20 tokens, which are widely used across the Ethereum ecosystem. Buterin’s comment reflects his long-standing belief in the importance of simplifying transactions and enhancing user experience across Ethereum’s many layers.

      "description": "The post MOG, BABYDOGE, and DOG Meme Coins Eye Major Gains Amid Market Volatility! appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.With the recent surge in the selling spree in the crypto market, the anticipation of an October rally is limited. However, the recent spike in BTC to $62k resulted in a sudden demand spike for meme coins. Under such conditions, the top three meme coins listed in this analysis are expected to surge higher next week. So, let’s look at these top coins to buy next week. Top Meme Coins To Buy Next Week: Mog Coin (MOG) With a bullish reversal from the $0.00000069 support level, the MOG meme coin shows a V-shaped reversal. The uptrend surpasses the 200-day and 50-day EMA to hit the 61.80% Fib level at $0.000001712. Amid market correction, the MOG price falls to the 38.20% level at $0.0000013 mark. Nevertheless, the underlying demand leads to a morning star pattern with a 12.69% surge last night. Based on the Fibonacci levels, if the bull cycle exceeds the 61.80% level, the meme coin can reach the $0.000023544 mark. On the flip side, the crucial supports are at $0.0000013 and $0.0000010. BabyDoge Coin (BABYDOGE) Following a bullish breakout rally of a falling wedge, BABYDOGE hits the 61.80% Fibonacci level at $0.0000002782. However, the breakout run takes a quick turnaround to $0.0000001800 and is now struggling to surpass the $0.00000020 psychological mark. With a golden crossover in the 50D and 200D EMA, the BABYDOGE coin shows a potential double-bottom reversal. Based on the Fibonacci levels, the uptrend is likely to hit the $0.00000040 mark if the bullish momentum revives. DOG (RUNES) (DOG) Similar to BabyDoge Coin, the DOG coin shows a falling wedge breakout as it asserts dominance at the $0.0020 mark. With lower price rejection and a price jump above the 50-day EMA, the bull run is likely to continue in the meme coin. With a 14% surge last...",

      "content": "Flockerz ($FLOCK) changes the game for meme coins, and its presale is gathering a serious pace. They’ve raised $400K, with $40K of that coming in the past 24 hours. Investors are glued to its use case, which gives all token holders a say on the project’s future. Moreover, Flockerz will even pay users to participate in its governance. They’re calling it “Vote-to-Earn.” It’s something we’ve never seen before – is it the next big thing for meme coins? Investors flock to Flockerz presale, social media blows up as total raise hits $400K Flockerz is starting to go viral. Market participants are watching closely because if it does become the next big thing, those who buy today will be some of the earliest adopters. And with $400K raised in the presale, it’s becoming clear that there’s a real market appetite. This indicates there will be big demand potential after it launches on exchanges. And it helps that investing in the Flockerz presale is easy. Investors simply visit the project’s website, connect their wallets, and choose the crypto they want to pay with and the amount they want to buy. The presale accepts ETH, BNB, USDT, and even bank card payments. As investors pile into the presale, its social media channels are blowing up. Over 1,900 people now follow its X account, jumping around 150 followers in the past day. Meanwhile, it has also amassed 2,100 on Telegram . And it’s not just followers. They’re also getting a lot of engagement from their posts. Rally the flock – up only season incoming 📈 pic.twitter.com/sIldkDF4oD The hype is real for this new project – but what’s it all about? Governance and staking utility separate $FLOCK from useless joke tokens As mentioned, Flockerz’s whole shtick is putting the power in the hands of its community. Here’s the deal with many other meme coins: They’re controlled by centralized teams, which is completely against the tenet of crypto decentralization. Just look at Pepe. In August 2023, a group of rag-tag team members ran off with $15 million from the project’s treasury. It’s a real elephant in the room – people only overlook it because of the huge gains that meme coins often provide. But now, Flockerz is tackling the issue head-on. They’re creating “FlockTopia,” crypto’s first Vote-to-Earn decentralized autonomous exchange. Not only will users get to shape the project’s future – ensuring all decisions are made for the good of the community – but they’ll even get paid for doing it. It’s an ingenious concept that encourages community participation while aligning user incentives with the project’s success. But that’s not all. $FLOCK holders can also stake their tokens to generate even more rewards. Staking is live amid the presale, offering a whopping 5,400% APY. And don’t worry – it’s not too good to be true. The APY will gradually decrease as more investors stake their tokens. It’s so high today because the presale has only just launched. Those who stake now will be among the highest-ever staking earners. We should also mention that the $FLOCK presale price will increase incrementally. The current price is $0.0056785, but the next uptick will occur later today. Analyst speculates bird meme coins to take flight after hippo token MOODENG does 10,000x In a recent video, Jacob Bury nodded toward up to 10,000x gains for Flockerz. He appeared on the 99Bitcoins YouTube channel and cited the meteoric success of the hippo-themed meme coin MOODENG, which recently did a 10,000x. Anything can happen in the meme coin space. Narratives arise from the abyss. One day dog coins are pumping, then it’s cats, then hippos. Is the bird meta up next? We’ll find out soon. But one thing is for sure – Flockerz is a must-watch for anyone interested in emerging meme coins. The project’s novel Vote-to-Earn and staking utility separate it from its peers, and the market is already showing significant interest. Visit Flockerz Presale",

      "description": "The post Bitcoin Struggles In Early October: Bullish Rebound Ahead For BTC? appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Bitcoin (BTC) has faced a rough start to the historically bullish month of October, impacted by escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Despite this, bulls remain hopeful for a turnaround later in the month. Bitcoin’s “Uptober” Off To A Patchy Start The leading digital asset by reported market cap had a tumultuous beginning to its most bullish month since 2013. The chart below depicts how October has historically been the most bullish month for Bitcoin, giving a median return of 21.2%. Source: CoinGlass.com Yesterday, BTC briefly plunged below the critical $60,000 level before rebounding to $61,179 at press time. During this see-sawing price movement, BTC witnessed liquidations worth over $32 million, while ETH liquidations stood slightly above $18 million. Source: CoinGlass.com Over the past seven days, Bitcoin has tumbled by 6.9%, while major altcoins have experienced even greater losses. Ethereum (ETH) is down 11.2%, Solana (SOL) has dropped 10.9%, and BNB has declined by 9.9%. According to data from CoinGlass, most of BTC’s price appreciation typically occurs in the latter part of October. The chart below illustrates that the initial days of October have historically been less favorable for BTC prices. Source: CoinGlass.com Notably, October 1 has been positive for Bitcoin only once since 2013, while October 2 has shown gains five times out of eleven. In contrast, later dates, such as October 28, have delivered positive returns nine times out of eleven, followed by October 20, which has had eight positive days out of eleven. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s most bearish month, September, closed with gains of 7.29% this year, clocking in its best performance since 2013. Multiple Factors Weighing On Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving in April 2024, followed by the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate cuts in September, two events typically...",

      "content": "72.27% of Binance traders are going long on the ETHUSDT pair. ETH could soar by 15% to reach the $2,815 level if ETH stays above the $2,330 level. Recently, whales accumulated nearly 28,120 ETH worth $66 million. ETHUSDT traders are extremely bullish as bet on the long position skyrockets. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass, 72.27% of Binance traders are going long on the ETHUSDT pair. It appears that traders have a strong conviction that the price of Ethereum will rise in the coming days. Meanwhile, 27.73% of Binance traders are still holding short positions, believing that the price will drop in the coming days. Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, Ethereum remains in a position where it could soon skyrocket. Currently, ETH is supported by an ascending trendline and experiencing upward momentum. Based on the historical price momentum, there is a strong possibility that ETH could soar by 15% to reach the $2,815 level in the coming days. However, ETH’s recent doji candle at the support level has shifted the sentiment slightly from a downtrend to an uptrend. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that ETH is currently in an oversold zone, hinting at a possible price reversal. This bullish thesis will only hold if ETH stays above the $2,330 level, otherwise, it may fail. On-Chain Metrics Despite this positive outlook, ETH’s other on-chain metrics signal weak market sentiment. Coinglass’s ETH future open interest has declined by 1.2% in the past 24 hours, indicating reduced trader conviction as they may hesitate to build new positions. Ether Current Price Momentum At press time, Ether is trading near $2,415 and has experienced a slight price decline of over 0.45% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 38%, indicating lower participation from traders amid ongoing price reversal. Despite the mixed sentiment among traders, whales and institutions appear more confident, as they have started accumulating ETH following a recent price decline of 10%. On October 3, 2024, whales accumulated nearly 28,120 ETH worth $66 million, as reported by Coinpedia .",

      "description": "The post Qubetics Leads the Charge Against Quantum Threats, EcoChain Presale Soars and Celestia Set for Growth appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Are you ready to discover the blockchain projects that are making a huge impact in the crypto market? Let’s look at Qubetics, a new blockchain project while checking in on popular projects like Ecochain and Celestia. Quantum computers represent a serious danger to digital security because they can quickly crack conventional encryption schemes. Data security and cyber risk management will become crucial in the upcoming years as a result of this capability. With its quantum resistant addressing scheme, Qubetics (TICS), a pioneering layer-1 blockchain, is ready to protect from this looming danger. The blockchain project is committed to safeguarding digital assets against potential vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing. Qubetics presale is now live and it promises great financial returns to early investors alongside advanced security and scalability. Qubetics: A New Approach to Digital Defense Against Quantum Dangers The rise of quantum computers is creating real challenges for our current cryptographic systems, which puts our communications and data at risk. That’s why Qubetics is focused on improving security in the cryptocurrency world. Consider its quantum-resistant addressing to be like a high-tech lock for your digital safe that is resistant to attacks from quantum computing in the future. Qubetics unique strategy makes use of sophisticated post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, which are multivariate polynomial and lattice-based encryption. These algorithms are chosen because they are resistant to quantum attacks. This mechanism protects transactions, personal data, and the integrity of the blockchain from potential threats. To further guarantee that its platform is resilient against the risks posed by quantum computing, the project regularly evaluates its security. Celestia Set for Surge: Strong Support Signals 60% Upside Potential According to analyst CryptoJobs, TIA is presently trapped in a band of prices between $5.30 and $5.00, suggesting a period of consolidation.

      "description": "The post BNB Slips While BDAG Attracts Crypto Whales; SHIB Price Prediction appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.The cryptocurrency landscape is experiencing significant shifts, with Shiba Inu’s forecast signaling a possible rebound after a turbulent price year. Meanwhile, BNB is struggling as indicators of a bearish trend suggest a potential decline that could impact its market position. BlockDAG, a leading cryptocurrency project in its presale phase, has captured the attention of major market players with an impressive performance, amassing a total of $84.2 million in presales. This includes a remarkable single-day increase of $2 million followed by an additional $3 million the next day. BlockDAG is currently providing a time-limited 50% bonus for buyers up until October 14. This offer has not only engaged the crypto community but has also solidified BlockDAG’s presence in the cryptocurrency scene. Shiba Inu Prediction: Watching Market Trends Predictions suggest Shiba Inu might see a significant rise after an initial spike of over 300% earlier this year, which raised its price from $0.00000925 to $0.00004. The excitement waned as the value dropped by nearly 70%. Present market trends for Shiba Inu suggest a chance for recovery as it starts to regain momentum. Recent technical analyses provide a positive outlook for Shiba Inu, with a break from a longstanding downtrend indicating potential upward movement. This progress offers hope for holders as forecasts now suggest sustaining above critical resistance levels. BNB Could Be Heading for a Downturn Recent analyses show concerning signs for Binance Coin (BNB), with emerging bearish patterns pointing to a likely decline in price. The cryptocurrency initially surged but now faces a potential downturn, highlighted by a triple-top pattern on the daily chart. Additionally, the emergence of an evening star candlestick pattern near the $605 resistance level underscores the shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. These technical indicators, along with unfavorable on-chain data, suggest a forthcoming drop in BNB’s price....",

      "content": "Amid increased price volatility in the cryptocurrency market, top tokens continue recording a mixed price sentiment. Moreover, limelight tokens such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are currently hovering close to critical ranges. Further, with a bearish start to “Uptober”, will these tokens make a comeback in the near future? To uncover such a mystery, let us understand the market sentiments and potential price targets of these tokens. BTC Price Reclaims $62,000 Mark! With repeated rejection at its resistance trendline, the Bitcoin price has continued trading within the falling channel pattern since March. Moreover, failing to hold its value above $66k, it has dropped ~6% in 7 days. The EMA 50/200-day shows a high possibility of a Death Cross in the 1D time frame, highlighting a weak bullish sentiment for the market leader in the crypto space. Further, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues hovering close to its neutral point with its average trendline recording a constant decline. This suggests a negative outlook for the Bitcoin price this week. If the bullish momentum resurfaces, this could result in the BTC crypto price heading toward its resistance level of $66,000. On the flip side, a bearish action could pull the price toward its low of $60k. ETH Price Holds Its $2.4k Level! Amid ongoing market turmoil, the Ethereum price dropped ~10% over the past seven days. Notably, the ETH price records its 5th failed attempt to break out of its major resistance level. With the second-largest crypto token recording a consolidated action, the technical indicators have turned neutral. This highlights uncertainty in the future price action of the Ethereum token. Suppose, a bullish reversal occurs, in that case, the ETH coin price could retest its $2.8k level. Conversely, if the bears dominate the crypto space, the price could drop toward a new yearly low. Ripple Price Eyes To Retest $0.560 This Uptober? With a bullish rebound, the XRP price has held its value above the $0.50 mark. However, with the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit gaining momentum, the 7th largest cryptocurrency hints at a mixed price sentiment. The EMA 50/200-day shows a potential Death Cross in the 1D time frame with the RSI indicator hovering close to its oversold range. This highlights a weak bullish action in the market. If the XRP token reclaims the $0.56 mark, it could potentially retest its yearly high of $0.72 during the upcoming weeks. However, if the situation favors the SEC, the Ripple token could plunge to $0.42 this year. Concerned about your XRP holdings? Read our Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction for potential price targets!",

However, the analyst said that he still continues to hold the altcoin basket in addition to his hedge positions and that this is his plan. Il Capo, who also published a chart about Ethereum, argued that the ETH price may be following a Wyckoff Accumulation model. According to the analyst, the BTC price may see a bounce from here after a drop to the $ 2,000 level, causing its price to jump to the $ 3,500 level. In his statement before the latest jump, il Capo argued that the current situation in Bitcoin was similar to the consolidation before the Covid crash and called for caution. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $62,198. *This is not investment advice. Follow our Telegram and Twitter account now for exclusive news, analytics and on-chain data!

      "description": "The post Popcat boasts 35% surge driven by improved trader sentiment appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Popcat emerged as the top gainer this week, driven by improved trader sentiment and a sharp rise in its futures open interest. Popcat (POPCAT) rose over 35% in the last seven days, hitting a new all-time high of $1.26 on Oct. 5. Most of these gains came within the last 24 hours. the token rose 20.6% from its intraday low of $0.98. The Solana-based token was also up 112% over the past month, making it the second-largest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, boasting a market cap exceeding $1.2 billion, according to CoinGecko. One of the key bullish arguments for Popcat is its widely distributed ownership, with large holders controlling just 17% of the total supply per CoinCarp data. The same cannot be said for its competitors like Bonk (BONK) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which are far more concentrated, with the top 10 wallets holding 52% and 61% of the supply, respectively. This makes Popcat less vulnerable to “whale” manipulation and offers a more stable, balanced trading environment. Bulls remain in control The coin’s futures open interest is up 344% to a record $191.11 million, signaling that traders are heavily positioning for further price gains. On the 1D POPCAT/USDT chart, the recent price action has pushed the token above the upper Bollinger Band, currently at $1.865, confirming the strong upward momentum. However, this also means that the token has reached an overbought zone. This is reinforced by the Commodity Channel Index spiking to 222.2, well above the 100 threshold that indicates overbought conditions. POPCAT price, Bollinger Bands and CCI chart | Source: crypto.news Although these technical signals suggest the potential for a market correction, the token’s successful retest of the upper Bollinger Band earlier today reinforces the idea that bulls remain in control. This could point to continued upward momentum...",

      "description": "The post Israeli-Iranian Conflict Could Push BTC to 55k appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.The Israeli-Iranian conflict has escalated with limited impact on traditional financial markets but a stronger hit to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoin dropped 4%, finding support at $60,000, but further escalation could push it lower. The ongoing Israeli-Iranian conflict has intensified, drawing global attention and impacting financial markets. Earlier this week, Israel started an invasion of Lebanon on the ground, and yesterday, Iran responded with more than 180 missiles. However, the traditional financial markets (TradFi) responded only mildly to these events. The S&P 500 declined by 1 % at the same time as WTI crude oil increased by 2%. Given today’s price movements, we do not expect any significant further losses in these sectors. However, the cryptocurrency market was not spared; instead, it received a bigger blow. Bitcoin (BTC) closed 4% lower, currently finding some support at the $60,000 level. According to data from QCP, with further geopolitical tensions, BTC may fall to $55,000. This aggressive selloff shows that crypto markets are way more sensitive to price swings than other asset classes, but risk sentiment remains positive. Popular analyst Justin Bennett also estimates that Bitcoin may decline to $57,000. Justin Bennett has predicted a decline in Bitcoin’s price to $57,000 because of the bearish market outlook. The analyst noted that this level is important for preserving a positive attitude towards cryptocurrency. He also added that the price of Bitcoin is still bearish as long as it is below $62,000. Although the Bitcoin price briefly surpassed $61k again, Bennett warned that the asset is still under pressure after failing to hold $64,700. He also highlighted that as $57,000 is quite possible, $51,000 should not be completely written off, albeit not very possible. Macroeconomic Factors Drive Optimism for Bitcoin’s Future Despite the short-term risks, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Several macroeconomic...",

Trump Ends SEC (TRUMESEC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMESEC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Ends SEC can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Ends SEC could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Ends SEC launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Trump Ends SEC on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Ends SEC by entering its contract address – D5gG1fhhqmczCDbDGsqAhWZWZDkVWPYU5xrj55QbcTr2 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMESEC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",

      "content": "USA Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Net Inflow of $25.6M on October 4, Led by Bitwise and Fidelity On October 4 , U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a significant net inflow of $25.6 million , according to data from Farside Investors . The inflows were driven primarily by Bitwise’s BITB , which recorded the largest inflow of $15.3 million , followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $13.6 million , Ark Invest’s ARKB and VanEck’s HODL , both registering $5.3 million . In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC saw a net outflow of $13.9 million , making it the only major ETF to experience a negative flow on the day. Other ETFs did not see any notable changes in net inflows or outflows. Breakdown of ETF Movements Bitwise’s BITB led the market with $15.3 million in net inflows, reflecting growing confidence in its strategy for tracking spot Bitcoin prices. Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely with $13.6 million , demonstrating strong investor interest in Bitcoin ETFs offered by traditional financial institutions. Ark Invest’s ARKB and VanEck’s HODL both recorded $5.3 million in net inflows, further highlighting the broader investor demand for Bitcoin exposure. Grayscale’s GBTC , which has traditionally been a major player in the Bitcoin ETF space, faced $13.9 million in net outflows , signaling a potential shift in investor preferences as newer ETFs gain traction. Investor Sentiment Shifting Toward Spot Bitcoin ETFs The latest net inflows indicate a growing appetite for Bitcoin ETFs , as more institutional and retail investors seek to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. The performance of Bitwise , Fidelity , and Ark Invest’s ETFs suggests a shift in market sentiment toward newer, more dynamic Bitcoin offerings, with spot ETFs becoming the preferred vehicle for gaining exposure. Grayscale’s Outflow: A Sign of Shifting Preferences? The $13.9 million outflow from Grayscale’s GBTC could reflect a growing preference for more liquid and straightforward Bitcoin ETFs, particularly those structured around spot prices . As newer ETFs with lower fees and better liquidity enter the market, GBTC’s traditional appeal may be waning, leading to increased outflows in favor of alternative products. Conclusion The net inflow of $25.6 million into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on October 4 highlights the sustained demand for Bitcoin exposure via ETFs. With Bitwise and Fidelity leading the charge, investors are showing increasing confidence in the spot ETF market . However, Grayscale’s GBTC outflow serves as a reminder that competition in the space is intensifying, as newer ETFs gain favor among investors seeking better liquidity and transparency.

The transaction, as shared by Spotonchain, took place within a span of half an hour. Buterin exchanged various tokens for 140.6 Ethereum (ETH), worth approximately $360,000 in fiat currency.Details of the Sale According to Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu, Buterin's sales included 70.71 million Neiro, 11.76 billion MOODENG, 7.8 million DEGEN, and 16.03 billion KABOSU. These tokens were sent to exchanges, along with 100,000 USDT, which had been donated to him by the CATE project. Importantly, Buterin had received these tokens for free from their developers.https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1842516705203089463In total, Buterin's sale earned him 140.6 ETH. At the time of the transaction, Ethereum was priced around $2,416. These sales were completed quickly, and the tokens were traded at a time when the price of ETH had recently seen a small 2.2% increase in value.Donation to TornadoCash Legal Defense Spotonchain further reported that Buterin contributed 100 ETH, worth about $242,000, to support the legal defense of TornadoCash developers Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm. The developers are currently in custody, facing charges related to their work on the privacy-focused platform.https://twitter.com/spotonchain/status/1842513892888715522Earlier this week, Buterin was also observed moving 649 ETH, valued at $1.79 million, to Paxos. This coincided with a minor 1% dip in Ethereum’s price. While sales by prominent figures like Buterin do not always have an immediate impact on the market, they are closely monitored due to their potential to influence prices.",

This occurs when the price makes higher highs while the RSI indicator makes lower highs, signaling a potential weakening of upward momentum and a possible SUI price drop or correction. $SUI –> Where to buy? Technically, there are better +EV opportunities, but SUI is likely one of the coins achieving the top 10 at the end of the cycle. The aggressive entry point is $1.50-1.60. The Conservative entry point is $1.30-1.40. Targets? New all-time highs. pic.twitter.com/izBLvVguaq The chart highlights two potential entry zones for traders. An aggressive entry zone between $1.50 and $1.60 suggests that traders with a higher risk tolerance could consider entering positions here. This area has been marked as a potential support, located around previous consolidation areas. A more conservative entry zone is identified between $1.30 and $1.40. This lower area may serve as a stronger support level, given that it coincides with earlier resistance levels that were broken and turned into support. This could represent a safer entry point for traders looking for a higher probability setup. Read also: Bittensor Price Surges: How High Can TAO Go? Key Levels To Watch Volume and SUI Price Action The volume shows a surge during the initial price rise and begins to taper off as the price consolidates near the high. Decreasing volume during consolidation can often signal that a breakout or breakdown is imminent. Based on the price action, SUI appears to be in the midst of a bearish pullback following a local high. The price seems to have broken from its upward momentum, showing a pullback that might soon enter the aggressive entry zone. Doge2014 raises 500K in days celebrating Dogecoin. Make potentially big profits and get in on exclusive airdrop ! Key Levels to Watch The chart indicates a possible resistance around the $2.00 mark, where the price previously faced rejection. Breaking through this level could potentially send the price towards its all-time high (ATH) of $2.18. Support levels to watch include the $1.60 level (aggressive entry zone) and $1.40 (conservative zone). If the price fails to hold the $1.40 support zone, it could experience further downside pressure, potentially testing even lower levels.

SUI Price Prediction In his tweet, Van de Poppe suggests that there may be better expected value (EV) opportunities in other assets, implying that while SUI has potential , there might be higher-probability trades elsewhere in the short term. He distinguishes between aggressive and conservative entry strategies, with the $1.50-$1.60 zone for aggressive traders willing to enter on a slight pullback, and the $1.30-$1.40 zone for more conservative traders who prefer a deeper retracement before entering. The main target mentioned is new all-time highs, specifically $2.18. Once the price clears the local resistance, traders are anticipating a move back to these highs. Notably, Van de Poppe mentions SUI’s potential to reach the top 10 by the end of the cycle, indicating bullish sentiment and an expectation that SUI will outperform many other assets in the current market cycle.

      "description": "Qubetics’ live crypto presale crosses $1M in 24 hours, TRON is in the spotlight for $577 million in revenue in the third quarter, and KRYZA is struggling to gain traction—explore how these three cryptos are making strides.",
      "content": "As global regulatory efforts ramp up, crypto analysts predict a transformative shift in cryptocurrency governance. Stricter rules to enhance consumer protection and corporate accountability will imply significant changes in the crypto space. Amidst this evolving landscape, platforms like Tron, KRYZA, and Qubetics are emerging as resilient players. Qubetics is carving its path with the immaculate blockchain platform that is bringing forth innovation and is gaining traction. On the other hand, Tron is pushing the limits of blockchain technology, and the results are evident in its success. Meanwhile, KRD is trying to mark its dominance among the live crypto presales. Let’s evaluate their positions! Safe, Private, Profitable: Qubetics’ dVPN Qubetics’ decentralised VPN (dVPN) is a game-changer for all who fear the restrictions that might hinder the digital economy’s growth. The latest technology enhances security and privacy and creates a unique opportunity for users to earn by sharing bandwidth, rewarding them with $TICS tokens. Imagine accessing the internet free from censorship, with multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption ensuring your anonymity. What can be better than this? Whether you’re handling digital assets or engaging in global commerce, Qubetics’ dVPN helps you safely explore the financial opportunities the digital world offers while maintaining complete privacy regardless of where you live. Qubetics’ Lead: $1.14M in a Day, $TICS Token at $0.012 Qubetics has made an explosive entrance into the crypto world. In less than 24 hours of the launch, the company raised more than $1 million—a remarkable figure by any standard. This rapid success reflects the strong confidence investors have in the platform and the innovations it brings. With the current $0.012 per $TICS token, all eyes are on Qubetics’s live crypto presale. Qubetics encourages users by giving $TICS tokens to the bandwidth providers. Its decentralised architecture strengthens security and resistance to censorship, making it a vital tool for users navigating the complexities of the digital economy. TRON Hits Revenue Milestone With 43% Increase TRON has achieved yet another milestone by hitting a revenue mark of $577 million in Q3 2024, the highest revenue yet. This represents a 43% increase from the previous quarter, thus further emphasising TRON’s place in the stablecoin segment and its strategic ventures, such as the SunPump meme coin generator venture. Despite the success in revenue, TRX’s price experienced a slight dip, trading around $0.154, which is more reflective of broader market conditions than any issue with TRON’s performance. KRD’s Decentralisation – Is It Working? With the presale of KRYZA (KRD) coin in the rush, the platform emphasised its commitment to decentralisation by renouncing token ownership in the second quarter of 2024. This move not only stabilised the project but enhanced trust within the crypto community, paving the way for long-term growth. Trading at $0.0076 on the KRYZA Exchange (KRX) with a $30,000 daily volume, KRYZA is trying to be ahead of the live crypto presales in 2024. Conclusion KRYZA and Qubetics are all in the news. Qubetics raised over $1.14M in 24 hours following the launch of its token. KRX has gotten quite a lot of attention among the live crypto presales. Likewise, TRON continues to reach new revenue milestones and maintains its status as a top blockchain contender. The live crypto presale for Qubetics has been nothing short of phenomenal. This strong start highlights the demand for its innovative blockchain solutions, making it a top contender in the presale space.

      "description": "The post USA September Payroll Report Boosts Likelihood of Quarter-Point Rate Cut in November appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.USA September Payroll Report Boosts Likelihood of Quarter-Point Rate Cut in November The stronger-than-expected U.S. payroll report for September has increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will opt for a quarter-point rate cut during its November meeting, according to Nick Timiraos, the chief economics correspondent for The Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Timiraos suggested that this moderate approach aligns with the Fed’s recalibration strategy following a half-point cut in the previous month, which was prompted by signs of mild inflation and a cooling labor market. September Payrolls Strengthen Fed’s Cautious Approach The recent payroll data revealed stronger hiring trends than initially anticipated, especially in July, August, and September. The September report indicated a healthier labor market, leading the Fed to reassess its stance on further rate cuts. This aligns with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s statement on September 30, in which he emphasized that the Fed is not in a hurry to implement additional rate cuts. While some analysts had speculated about the possibility of another half-point rate cut, September’s robust employment figures have made it more likely that the Fed will take a measured approach and reduce rates by 0.25% instead. The Fed’s Recalibration Strategy Following last month’s half-point reduction, the Fed appears to be adopting a more gradual strategy as it responds to evolving economic conditions. The initial larger-than-usual rate cut was a response to emerging concerns about inflation and signs of weakness in the labor market. However, with recent revisions indicating stronger-than-expected hiring in July and August, the Fed may now opt for caution, avoiding overly aggressive moves that could risk overstimulating the economy. Implications for the Economy If the Federal Reserve proceeds with a quarter-point rate cut in November, it could signal the central bank’s commitment to balancing economic growth with inflation control. A moderate cut...",

      "description": "The post BDAG Presale with $3M in One Day appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.The cryptocurrency market is currently showcasing some exciting developments, with Solana maintaining a steady price range between $130 and $190, highlighting its reliability amidst market fluctuations. Simultaneously, Polkadot is capturing attention with its bullish trend and potential for growth, supported by its pivotal role in enabling interoperable blockchain transactions. In a significant leap forward, BlockDAG has raised over $3 million on the very first day of its presale, following the launch of its testnet. This remarkable achievement underscores the project’s burgeoning influence and the strong market confidence in its technological capabilities, setting a robust foundation for future growth. Earlier, BlockDAG had introduced a limited-time incentive, offering a 50% bonus on all BDAG coin purchases. This strategic move has not only elevated the presale total to an impressive $84.2 million but has also heightened anticipation for what’s next, solidifying BlockDAG’s status among the elite crypto projects. Solana’s Pricing Dynamics: Stable Yet Promising Despite some market projections suggesting Solana could reach as high as $300, thanks to its efficient, cost-effective blockchain technology, it has remained in a more contained range between $130 and $190. This steadiness, especially following a significant upswing from under $20 a year ago, indicates that Solana might have reached a plateau for this cycle. However, this stability could be seen as a strength, providing a reliable foundation for future advancements and sustained interest from the community. Whales Rally Around BlockDAG’s Testnet Launch with Enthusiastic Acquisitions BlockDAG has recently catapulted itself towards becoming a tier 1 network with the successful launch of its testnet. This significant development has infused the project with vigor, amassing over $3 million within the first 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Bittensor’s decentralized AI model is driving TAO’s price higher, with analysts expecting even more growth ahead. But BlockDAG is stealing the show with its $1 million giveaway, where 50 winners will bag $20,000 each. The buzz has supercharged demand for BDAG coins, pushing the presale beyond $84.2 million—$3 million of which was raised in just 24 hours. With institutional buyers piling in, BlockDAG’s rapid momentum is positioning it as one of the most talked-about cryptos heading into 2024. Ethereum Staking: A Growing Force in the Crypto World Ethereum staking yields are rising fast, currently sitting at 3.19%, well above the federal funds rate. The surge is driven by lower U.S. debt returns and skyrocketing Ethereum transaction fees, making staking an increasingly attractive option. As transaction fees hit new highs, staking profits are climbing too, sparking even more interest. Looking forward, Ethereum staking could become even more lucrative. With the federal funds rate expected to drop below 3.50-3.75% by 2025, staking yields may continue to climb. However, traditional investors face some barriers, as access to staking remains limited in mainstream markets. Bittensor Price Prediction – TAO’s AI-Driven Rise Bittensor’s decentralized AI model has sparked a massive 105% rise in TAO’s price over the past month. The outlook for Bittensor remains strong, especially with the upcoming launch of BIT001 adding fuel to the fire. Despite market volatility, TAO’s focus on AI-driven technology could propel its price to $640 by October. The booming interest in AI applications across the crypto landscape adds even more weight to these bullish predictions, making Bittensor one to watch.

      "content": "The SEC has filed an appeal against a previous ruling that deemed programmatic sales of XRP as not constituting investment contracts, a decision that significantly reduced the penalties Ripple faced. However, there has been a lot of confusion regarding this appeal and XRP enthusiasts took to social media to express their frustration. Additionally, discussions centered around the complexities surrounding secondary sales of XRP, clarifying that the court did not specifically rule on transactions involving retail investors trading on exchanges. A user asked whether the SEC’s recent appeal letter only referenced the penalties judgment, not the broader ruling from last year, and if this limits the SEC to appealing just the penalties aspect. Marc explained that the appeal references the final judgment, which triggers both parties’ rights to appeal. This judgment also finalizes the previous year’s summary ruling, which is the main focus of the SEC’s appeal, though penalties and disgorgement will likely be included as well. They don't really care about the money; it doesn't even go to them. So, sure, they will likely make arguments about the penalty (and certainly the absence of disgorgement) as long as they're appealing; but that's not the primary objective of the appeal. In response to another question about whether the SEC will appeal everything or just the fine and Ripple’s sales of XRP, Marc indicated that the SEC is likely to challenge the court’s decision that Ripple’s programmatic and non-cash XRP sales were not securities transactions. This had already been hinted at a year ago, with the inclusion of disgorgement and penalties, though the latter isn’t the central objective of the appeal. Another user said that the SEC originally requested much larger penalties than what was ultimately ruled by Judge Torres, suggesting the SEC was primarily focused on monetary penalties. Marc clarified that the SEC’s main objective is not the money itself, as it doesn’t go to them, though they will likely raise arguments regarding the penalty and the absence of disgorgement while pursuing the appeal.",

      "content": "Bitcoin holds above $62K with 53.89% dominance, boosting confidence in the crypto market. Total crypto market cap hits $2.28T, though the Fear & Greed Index still signals caution. Smaller tokens like Fu and Morphware surged amid Bitcoin’s strong performance. The cryptocurrency market is showing continued positive momentum, with Bitcoin climbing past $62,000. As per insights from CryptoRank, most of the top 10 cryptocurrencies are trading in the green, reflecting an overall upward trend and optimism within the sector. 📈Market Overview #Bitcoin trades above $62K. The top-10 cryptos are traded in green zone: $SOL +3.33% $BNB +2.19% $XRP +1.83% Market capitalization: $2.28T (+1.35%) The #BTC dominance: 53.89% (+0.43%) Fear & Greed Index: 49 (Fear) 👉 Top Gainers Fu $Fu +145.9% Morphware... pic.twitter.com/ps5cInpEoK Bitcoin Dominance Strengthens Platform data highlights Bitcoin’s sustained dominance at 53.89%, a 0.43% rise from previous levels. Solana (SOL) surged 3.33%, Binance Coin (BNB) gained 2.19%, and Ripple (XRP) saw a 1.83% increase, further boosting the overall market outlook. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is now $2.28 trillion, up 1.35 percent. While the momentum is strong, the Fear & Greed Index , at a reading of 49, shows that traders are not completely out of the woods yet and that market sentiment is treading the line between fear and greed. Altcoin Rally Continues The larger cryptocurrencies made steady gains, but smaller, less well-known tokens surged. Amongst the top gainers, Fu rallied 145.9%, Morphware (XMW) popped in by 57.1%, and DIA Token (DIA) shot by 51.7%. Other mentions include Cheems, with 34.4% increase, and OX FUN, with a 33.6% boost. The positive trend across many altcoins shows a bigger rally across the crypto market. Bitcoin’s strong showing above the $62K level has meant the confidence is high enough for smaller tokens to follow the wave of optimism. Even as Bitcoin’s dominance grows further, as usual in the crypto market, altcoins are doing well. This suggests that they grow cohesively across many digital assets. Though the market capitalization is approaching $2.3 trillion, the sector is still up and running for traders who seek the next break moment. The broader crypto market, meanwhile, has been boosted by Bitcoin’s strength at $62K or above, which saw top coins trading in the green. That rise benefited lesser-known tokens, too, which have also seen their value shoot upward.",

      "description": "The post Outages, TPS Misleading, and More appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Solana is known for its promise of high-speed blockchain technology. However, beneath its claims of superiority lie serious issues that undermine its reliability and decentralization. Essentially, there are three major problems in the Solana ecosystem currently: frequent network outages, misleading TPS metrics, and validator centralization. Frequent Outages Since its launch in 2020, Solana has experienced 12 major network outages, disrupting dApps, traders, and platforms. These outages often result from network congestion, validator errors, or bugs, some lasting as long as 17 hours. A notable example occurred in September 2021, causing chaos for users who couldn’t access their funds or complete trades during the downtime. Additionally, in January 2022, a DoS attack overwhelmed the network, further highlighting its fragility. For a blockchain with over $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) at the time, these disruptions have caused significant financial losses and diminished trust in the network’s reliability. TPS Myths Solana’s marketing boasts up to 65,000 TPS, a figure that far surpasses competitors like Ethereum. However, this number is misleading. In reality, Solana includes validator voting and failed transactions in its TPS calculation, artificially inflating the numbers. The actual TPS for user transactions is closer to 250 TPS, much lower than the marketed figure. For comparison, Ethereum processes 30 TPS for successful transactions, but Solana’s reported TPS includes activity that doesn’t directly benefit users. This misleading metric paints a false picture of Solana’s performance, making it seem far more capable than it actually is. Validator Centralization Unlike other blockchains that aim for decentralization, Solana’s validator network is highly centralized. The top 18 validators control over 33% of the staked supply, giving a small group significant influence over the network. This level of control allows validators to potentially censor transactions or block consensus. Becoming a validator on Solana is costly, with the...",

      "content": "Wake Forest University is facing a crucial test of its quality as a university. Will free speech and informed debate prevail, or will Wake Forest abandon essential elements of a university’s mission? It is understandable that a lecture by a scholar who focuses on the plight of the Palestinians was cancelled because it would fall on the anniversary of Oct. 7. But the examination of opposing and controversial viewpoints is part of the search for truth. Unless Wake Forest reschedules such a presentation at a later date, it will condemn itself as a frightened, second- or third-rate institution. Paul D. Escott Winston-Salem The writer is a history professor at Wake Forest University. People are also reading... There has been a lot of disinformation out there surrounding the International Longshoremen’s Association strike at East Coast ports after their contract expired at the end of September. Shipping industry bosses want us to blame workers for disruption when they themselves are to blame. The reality is that strikes are disruptive. But an industry that made $400 billion in profits since 2020 doesn’t care about that if it means they can keep giving workers the short end of the stick, even when these shipping industry tycoons would be worth $0 without workers. It is infuriating that, until a tentative agreement last week, shipping companies had refused to share their immense gains with workers who risked their lives during the height of COVID to create them, nor protect their jobs by adopting safeguards in regard to automation. Longshore workers’ fight is our fight as well — against obscene corporate profits on our backs, and for control over how technology is used in our workplaces. Dan Taylor Winston-Salem Every election in recent history has been touted as the most important in our history. But it has never been truer than it is for this election. We have one party that is actively working to undermine the foundations of our democracy by sowing doubt about the integrity of our election process. All the rhetoric about this is unfounded. The tedious and clerical process of processing voter registration and votes renders it practically impossible for fraud to be carried out. Anyone who thinks it is so easy to perpetrate fraud should work or at least observe in a Board of Elections office. At least do a little research to see that it just isn’t a reality. I urge your readers to vote for Justice Allison Riggs for the N.C. Supreme Court because she will fight to protect our democracy and its processes. Justice Riggs will also work to reinstate a woman’s right to make her health care reproductive decisions. She is the only woman of childbearing age on any of N.C. appellate courts Her opponent signed onto a judicial opinion, since withdrawn, that says “life begins at conception.” This is the same misguided logic used in other states to stop women’s access to reproductive health care. This election is not about party; it’s about deciding what kind of country we want to live in. Angela Pearman Winston-Salem In reference to the article “Trump ‘resorted to crimes’ after losing 2020 election in bid to keep power, prosecutors say”: Leave it to the Winston-Salem Journal to headline old news to sway opinion concerning the election. You don’t even pretend to be unbiased; way too obvious. These are the reasons I want to cancel my subscription. Craig Bradley Clemmons In the Oct. 1 vice-presidential debate, JD Vance lit into the governor of Minnesota (why him?) for Vice President Harris’ failure to stop the flood of migrants as “border czar.” It’s a favorite Republican talking point, just assumed; but there is no such position. In reality, President Biden tasked Harris in 2021 with investigating the causes of the migrant surge from Central America; he never assigned her to supervise and police the border. That wasn’t her job. It was Republicans who made up the term to belittle her and set her up for public shaming as migrants kept entering. This is what happens when a party that used to proudly state a platform of the values it stood for, settles instead for name-calling and glib talking points — easy, unsubstantiated claims that can be constantly repeated until people believe them. It’s the age-old strategy of the con man. Voters, please find out the truth before casting your votes. (In this case, just Google: “’Border Czar’ attribution.”) Stan Whitley Pfafftown Get opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!",

      "content": "UAE’s rising golf star, Rayan Ahmed, says his experience competing in the electrifying 15th edition of the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship (AAC) at Japan's prestigious Taiheiyo Club has supercharged his ambitions for the upcoming year. The tournament saw intense competition, with China’s Wenyi Ding delivering a masterclass, carding four rounds of 67 to claim victory with a stunning 12-under-par 268. Ahmed's performance on this elite stage has only ignited his drive for future success. Having finished second last year, the World Amateur Golf Ranking (WAGR) No 5 Ding took the title by just one shot from compatriot Ziqin Zhou (Chi). The home country had three finishers in the top six. The leading Middle East player was Khalid Attieh (KSA) who will now turn professional with starts on the Asian Tour as well as a conditional card on the Asian Development Tour (ADT). Seventeen-year-old Rayan shot rounds of 74, 72, 73, 73 for a four-round total of 292. Ahmed reflected on the week: “It has been a great experience competing in such a significant tournament. “The whole set-up, functions, player facilities, on-course scoreboards, caddies and everything else - the media attention, both TV, on course live as well as dealing with the local and UAE media. “I am excited with so many of the things I have learnt this week – perhaps my putting let me down at times – I must now work on this area of my game,” he added. “This week had a lot of WAGR points with such a quality field – so I hope my Ranking improves. “I am very proud to have represented the UAE this week. Thank you to the EGF, especially General Abdullah Alhashmi, Vice-Chairman of the EGF and the team.’ “I fly back tonight and then I am off to school on Tuesday. I have a lot of schoolwork to catch up on,” added Rayan. “This week has given me even more motivation to play next year when the UAE and Emirates Golf Club hosts the 16th edition of the AAC. My aim is now so much bigger – to win it for the UAE next year in Dubai – nothing less, I am all in. “My next event is the EGF’s UAE Cup at Al Ain Equestrian, Shooting & Golf Club, later this month,”| said Rayan. “This week has helped my confidence - I had my best ever career score there, a 63 in a JAGA event.” Representatives from the following Middle East countries competed this week: Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The AAC is the leading amateur golf tournament in the Asia region and was first played in 2009, and is supported by The R&A, The Masters and the APGC.

Preparations are underway, and both parties express optimism about their alliance despite challenges.",
      "content": "The upcoming bypolls for 10 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh are poised to be a critical litmus test for the INDIA bloc's unity. Following their impressive performance in the recent Lok Sabha elections—where they secured over 40 seats, significantly contributing to the BJP's failure to achieve a simple majority—the stakes are high for the coalition. Seat-Sharing Challenges Between Congress and Samajwadi Party Despite their shared objective of defeating the BJP, the two key allies within the INDIA bloc in Uttar Pradesh—the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress—are struggling to finalize a seat-sharing agreement for the bypolls. The Congress has claimed the right to contest five of the ten available seats, a proposition that may not sit well with the SP. Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Rai expressed optimism, stating, \"The party is holding 'Samvidhan Bachao Sammelan' (Save Constitution conferences) on all 10 assembly seats that are going to polls. Two such conferences have already been held. We have appointed incharges and observers on all the 10 seats, and groundwork is ongoing.\" Uttar Pradesh Bypoll Seats and Context The assembly seats set for bypolls include: Katehari (Ambedkar Nagar) Karhal (Mainpuri) Milkipur (Ayodhya) Meerapur (Muzaffarnagar) Ghaziabad Majhawan (Mirzapur) Sishamau (Kanpur City) Khair (Aligarh) Phulpur (Prayagraj) Kundarki (Moradabad) Nine of these seats became vacant after their MLAs were elected as MPs during the Lok Sabha elections, while the Sishamau seat is up for grabs due to the disqualification of SP MLA Irfan Solanki, who was convicted in a criminal case. Optimism for SP-Congress Alliance Continuation When asked about the likelihood of continuing the alliance for the bypolls, Rai confirmed, \"Yes, we will contest in alliance. The aim of both the Congress and the SP is to defeat the BJP.\" He elaborated on Congress's proposal to contest five specific assembly seats—Majhwa (Mirzapur), Phulpur (Allahabad), Ghaziabad, Khair (Aligarh), and Meerapur (Muzaffarnagar)—noting that these were previously won by BJP candidates. In the 2022 assembly elections , the SP won the Sisamau, Katehari, Karhal, Milkipur, and Kundarki seats, while the BJP secured Phulpur, Ghaziabad, Majhawan, and Khair. The Meerapur seat was held by the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). Samajwadi Party's Preparedness SP chief spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhury emphasized their readiness, stating, \"We are fully prepared for the polls. The INDIA bloc will win all the 10 seats.\" Regarding the Congress's demand for five seats, he noted, \"Baith ke tay hoga\" (We will sit together and decide), leaving the specifics of the seat-sharing discussions open-ended. Chowdhury further asserted that the BJP would not be able to exert undue influence at polling booths this time, adding, \"We are doing our preparations up to the booth level and emphasizing making our party strong at the booth level.\" The upcoming bypolls will undoubtedly have significant implications for the political landscape in Uttar Pradesh, with both the Congress and the SP striving for a united front against the BJP.",

      "description": "Mr Cleverly has stormed to second place in a survey of party members",
      "content": "James Cleverly has overtaken Robert Jenrick in the race to become the next Tory leader , a survey of party members suggests. The former home secretary, who was lagging behind, has stormed ahead to second place in members’ first preferences just days before the next round of voting. In a hypothetical head-to-head simulation of the final round of voting, conducted by grassroots Tory website Conservative Home , Mr Cleverly is now forecast to defeat Mr Jenrick for the first time. He would beat the former immigration minister by 54 to 36 per cent, while he would beat Tom Tugendhat by 67 to 18 per cent. Last week, the same polling showed that Mr Jenrick led Mr Cleverly by 51 per cent to 37 per cent. The strong performance comes after the former home secretary appeared to woo party members with his speech on the final day of the conference, which received the loudest cheers in the hall. It suggests he was not significantly damaged by a row over the Chagos Islands , which saw Mr Cleverly blamed for opening up talks to hand over the archipelago before being halted by his successor as foreign secretary, David Cameron . In a pointed tweet, Mr Tugendhat described the fact that the talks were opened under a Conservative government as “disgraceful”, though he did not namecheck Mr Cleverly. In first place is Kemi Badenoch , who the survey suggested would beat all three of her rivals in a hypothetical head-to-head simulating the final round of voting. She would beat Mr Cleverly by 48 to 42 per cent, the polling suggests. Ms Badenoch would beat Robert Jenrick by 53 to 33 per cent, while she would beat Tom Tugendhat by 62 to 28 per cent. It comes despite Ms Badenoch having had a difficult week at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, with missteps on maternity pay and her suggestion that some civil servants “should be in prison”. On Sunday, Ms Badenoch was endorsed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who described the shadow housing secretary as “strong and courageous” and commended her “commitment to conservative principles”. In a video released on Sunday, the one-time Republican candidate threw his weight behind Ms Badenoch, saying he is endorsing her as a result of their work together on a “great trade agreement between Florida and the United Kingdom”. “She has a commitment to conservative principles, she’s strong, she’s courageous and she will be an inspiration for conservatives not just in the United Kingdom, but all across the world”, Mr DeSantis said. “Our president Ronald Reagan once said that we need to stand for bold colours, not pale pastels. “Kemi flies the flag of bold colours, just like we do in Florida, just like you will do again in the United Kingdom.” The four candidates will be reduced to just two by 9 October after another round of voting from the parliamentary party. Party members will then vote for their favourite of the remaining two - but of course, their favourite candidate may not make the final cut. The survey for Conservative Home spoke to 793 Tory members between October 3 and 4.",

      "content": "As the demand for US visas continues to grow, UAE residents increasingly feel the impact of lengthy appointment wait times. Current estimates suggest that applicants from some countries face delays of 9 to 12 months, with some nationalities facing even longer waits of up to two years. According to Anastasia Yanchenko, commercial director of Visa Services, there are several reasons for these lengthy wait times. \"The differences in wait times can be attributed to the applicant's passport. UAE passport holders enjoy a shorter queue than their counterparts from countries with higher demand and fewer available appointments. \"For instance, while UAE citizens can access a more streamlined process, the wait for those holding Indian or Russian passports is about a year. In contrast, it's approximately two years for Iranian passport holders,\" Anastasia said. Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels. One of the factors contributing to these delays is the global accessibility of US visa applications. Individuals from various countries, including those without US embassies or those who have faced visa rejections in their home nations, also apply from the UAE. This influx of applications has led to a bottleneck in processing times. Anastasia explained that many travellers opt to combine their trips to Dubai with visa applications. \"The 'American dream' continues to draw people from the region, further compounding the situation and delaying the process for UAE residents. Many view Dubai as a temporary hub, as they seek to travel further.\" Certain countries such as Oman and Kyrgyzstan have imposed local restrictions on US visa applications without a local residence permit, pushing more applicants to the UAE for their visa needs. Various services are available for those looking to expedite their visa appointment, including reaching out to specialists who can help navigate the appointment booking process, ensuring that applicants can secure available slots more efficiently. To minimise risk in the visa application process and the prospect of a visa refusal, it is essential to follow key guidelines. Ensuring your application is complete, providing accurate documentation, and presenting a compelling case can significantly improve the chances of a successful outcome. Here are some effective strategies to help strengthen your application: Do not lie to the consul (neither during the interview nor on the application) — if this is discovered, a refusal will follow. Demonstrate strong ties to your home country through property ownership, children in school, and transparent banking history. Having a good travel history also matters. If the consul sees that you've travelled to the UK or Europe and returned to your home country, it's a small plus for you. Have a clear purpose for your trip . A travel plan should include where you are going, why, where you will stay, etc. Pay close attention to preparing for the interview. If applying through service providers, applicants can be guided by them on what to expect during the interview, including how to behave and how to respond to questions. As residents face long wait times for US visas, understanding the factors behind the delays and finding solutions can help make the journey smoother for those seeking to travel to the United States.",

      "description": "What sets abrosexuality apart from other orientations is its inherent changeability. Unlike bisexuality or pansexuality, which involve consistent attraction to multiple genders, abrosexuality involves fluctuations in attraction patterns",
      "content": "In this article, we will explain about the key characteristics of abrosexuality, and how it differs from other orientations. Have you ever felt your sexual orientation shift over time? If so, you may identify with abrosexuality. This fluid and dynamic sexual orientation reflects the ever-changing nature of human sexuality. As an abrosexual individual, you experience fluctuations in your sexual or romantic attractions. These shifts can occur rapidly or gradually, involving changes in gender preference, intensity of attraction, or even periods of asexuality. Understanding abrosexuality can provide valuable insights into the complexity and diversity of human sexual experiences. Abrosexuality is a dynamic and fluid sexual orientation characterised by changes in one’s sexual or romantic attractions over time. This fluidity can manifest in various ways, with shifts occurring in the gender(s) an individual is attracted to, the intensity of those attractions, or even periods of asexuality. For abrosexual individuals, these changes may happen rapidly or gradually, spanning days, weeks, or even months. It’s important to note that this fluidity is not a choice, but rather an intrinsic aspect of their sexual identity. What sets abrosexuality apart from other orientations is its inherent changeability. Unlike bisexuality or pansexuality, which involve consistent attraction to multiple genders, abrosexuality involves fluctuations in attraction patterns. This can sometimes lead to confusion or misunderstanding, both for abrosexual individuals and others. Understanding and accepting the fluid nature of abrosexuality is crucial for fostering inclusivity and supporting those who identify with this orientation. Recognising abrosexuality can be a journey of self-discovery. Here are some indicators that you might identify with this fluid sexual orientation: Fluctuating Attractions: You may notice your sexual or romantic attractions shift over time. These changes could occur rapidly, even daily, or span longer periods. One week, you might feel strongly attracted to men, while the next, you’re drawn to women or non-binary individuals. Intensity Variations: The strength of your attractions may also fluctuate. Sometimes, you might experience intense desires, while at other times, you feel little to no attraction at all. This ebb and flow is a hallmark of abrosexuality. Label Uncertainty: You might find it challenging to settle on a single label for your sexuality. Terms like gay, straight, or bisexual may feel fitting at times but inadequate at others. This difficulty in pinpointing a consistent identity is common among abrosexual individuals. Embracing Fluidity: If you resonate with these experiences, you may be abrosexual. Remember, sexuality is a spectrum, and fluidity is natural and valid. As with any sexual orientation, individuals who identify as abrosexual may face unique challenges in navigating their fluid sexuality. Emotional Impacts: The fluctuating nature of abrosexual attraction can lead to periods of confusion or self-doubt. You may experience anxiety or stress during shifts in attraction, questioning the validity of your feelings. It’s crucial to remember that these changes are a natural part of your identity. Social Challenges: Explaining abrosexuality to partners, family, or friends can be difficult, potentially leading to feelings of isolation or misunderstanding. You might face scepticism or dismissal from those unfamiliar with fluid sexualities. Building a supportive network of understanding individuals is key to maintaining good mental health. Self-Acceptance and Growth: Embracing your abrosexual identity can lead to increased self-awareness and personal growth. By acknowledging the fluidity of your attractions, you may develop greater emotional resilience and adaptability in various aspects of life. Coming out as abrosexual can be a challenging yet liberating experience. It’s important to approach this conversation with patience and understanding, as your loved ones may need time to grasp the concept of fluid sexuality. Preparing for the Conversation: Before initiating the discussion, educate yourself thoroughly about abrosexuality. This knowledge will help you explain your identity clearly and answer potential questions. Choose a comfortable, private setting for the conversation, and consider starting with close friends or supportive family members. Explaining Abrosexuality: When discussing your identity, use simple language and relatable examples. Explain that abrosexuality involves fluctuating sexual attraction over time, emphasising that it’s a valid and recognised orientation. Be prepared to clarify common misconceptions and provide resources for further learning. Navigating Reactions: Remember that reactions may vary. Some people might be immediately supportive, while others may need time to process the information. Stay calm and composed, even if faced with confusion or scepticism. Offer reassurance that your core identity remains unchanged, and express your desire for continued love and support. When navigating the dating world as an abrosexual individual, open communication is key. Be upfront about your fluid sexuality with potential partners, explaining that your attractions may shift over time. This honesty helps establish trust and understanding from the start. Abrosexuality often requires a flexible approach to relationships. You may find yourself drawn to different types of partnerships at various times. Some abrosexuals prefer open or polyamorous arrangements that allow for exploration as their attractions change. Others maintain monogamous relationships but openly discuss their shifting desires with their partner. Seek out partners who are understanding and accepting of your abrosexual identity. Look for individuals who value open communication and are comfortable with the potential for change in your relationship dynamic. As you explore and reflect on your own sexual identity, remember that abrosexuality is just one of many ways people experience attraction. Whether you identify as abrosexual or not, embracing the complexity and potential fluidity of human sexuality can lead to greater understanding – both of yourself and others. Ultimately, labels are simply tools to help articulate your authentic self. Focus on what feels true for you, knowing that your identity is valid regardless of how you choose to define it.",

      "description": "Newly-elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is likely to avoid skewing Sri Lanka’s foreign policy in favour of China at the expense of India; he is aiming for a more nuanced approach that fosters cooperation between the two countries",
      "content": "India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar concluded his one-day visit to the neighbouring island nation of Sri Lanka on October 4. His visit to Colombo comes in the backdrop of recently held presidential elections in Sri Lanka in September 2024, which saw the victory of left-leaning Marxist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, alias AKD. Jaishankar became the first high-level foreign delegate to meet newly elected President Dissanayake. The minister congratulated him and conveyed New Delhi’s commitment to “moving forward with the strong bilateral partnership” with Colombo. This may be one of the key instances where India, under Modi 3.0, has taken a proactive stance to engage with a strategically located island nation in the Indian Ocean, 33 km off the Indian coast. Noteworthy, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly congratulated the President-elect Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his party, adding, “Sri Lanka holds a special place in India’s Neighbourhood First Policy and Vision SAGAR.” It was promptly acknowledged by President-elect Dissanayake: “Thank you, Prime Minister Modi, for your kind words and support.” He added that he shared PM Modi’s ‘commitment to strengthening the ties between the nations’. And that together, they can work towards enhancing cooperation for the benefit of their people and the entire region. India’s Comeback in 2022 Since the 2022 economic crisis in Sri Lanka, India has made a comfortable landing in Sri Lanka through its financial assistance worth $ 4 billion towards humanitarian, medical, fuel, loan deferments, and currency swaps. India’s support during this turbulent time has enabled it to re-establish itself as a reliable partner and an influential player in Sri Lanka’s recovery and regional dynamics. Post-Rajapaksas, India managed to strike a delicate balance with former president Ranil Wickremesinghe, effectively voicing its concerns over the docking of Chinese spy ships along Sri Lanka’s coast and Beijing’s opaque investments in infrastructure projects, including the highly scrutinised Colombo Port City development. As a result of India’s financial assistance, a crucial change in the past two years favouring India in Sri Lanka has been a turnaround in public perception towards New Delhi. India’s recent past in the island nation was first marred by the 1987-1990 episode of the controversial Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) intervention, followed by Delhi’s support to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)—a militant organisation that sought an independent Tamil state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. A Pro-China President? Soon after the election results were announced on September 22, due to President Dissanayake’s Marxist and left-leaning political ideology, the media tagged him as a natural partner of China. This media narrative was reminiscent of the coverage when a Maoist government was formed in Nepal in 2008, which similarly saw an ideological alignment with Beijing. In both cases, the leaders’ political leanings, rooted in socialist and communist ideals, were seen as conducive to fostering closer ties with China. However, India is certainly not buying the media narrative. Interestingly, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake seems to be carefully treading the foreign policy by projecting a balanced approach towards India and China. He appears to be in no rush to court China, as India remains a critical financial partner in the ongoing economic reforms. Meanwhile, the close party-level ties between Dissanayake’s National People’s Power (NPP) and China’s Communist Party, which stem from shared ideological foundations, continue to develop. In April this year, a delegation of the Chinese Communist Party met Dissanayake and local party leaders of the NPP, signalling the potential for deeper engagement. Yet, despite these ties, the Sri Lankan leadership seems intent on maintaining a pragmatic and balanced foreign policy. Delhi’s Challenges Ahead The foremost challenge facing India would be to ensure the continuation of the progress made in bilateral relations in the past three years. Considering Sri Lanka needs India’s support in the IMF debt structuring, Delhi’s outreach with the current administration might be further boosted. In addition, India has offered to “modernise the Kankesanthurai port through a grant to the tune of $61.5 million”. And agreed that “payments for 7 completed Line of Credit projects to the tune of $20 million could be converted into grants. India has also decided to gift 22 diesel locomotives to the Sri Lankan Railways”. These initiatives reflect India’s commitment to strengthening ties and supporting Sri Lanka’s economic recovery. What might play a spoiler is President AKD’s political positioning against awarding a major wind energy project to India’s Adani Group by his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe. The project aims to develop a major 484 megawatts of wind power in Mannar and Pooneryn in the war-ravaged region, where the group is expected to invest $440 million in a 20-year-long agreement. The agreement became a hot topic during the presidential campaign. While Dissanayake may have his reservations about the deal given to the Adani Group, India is likely to continue pursuing this investment, emphasising the importance of economic cooperation in the region. Also, India has historically emphasised its “support for the aspirations of all communities, including Tamils, for equality, justice, dignity, and peace while maintaining the unity, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of Sri Lanka”. In this regard, India may want “the full and effective implementation of the 13th Amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution and the early holding of Provincial Council elections”. India’s push for the 13th Amendment, which devolves certain powers to provincial councils, may create an irritant due to opposition from nationalist factions who view it as a threat to the centralised authority of the Sri Lankan government. However, even if the 13th Amendment holds sentimental value for India due to its ethnic ties with the Tamil community, it will not hinder its pursuit of overall relations with Sri Lanka. New Delhi recognises the importance of maintaining a balanced approach, ensuring that support for Tamil rights does not compromise broader diplomatic and economic ties with Colombo. Lastly, India would want the current political dispensation in Sri Lanka to be mindful of New Delhi’s sensitivities while engaging with a third country, especially China. Undoubtedly, China is focused on sustaining momentum in its strategic cooperation with Sri Lanka, especially in the maritime domain, and it will be interesting to see how Beijing leverages Colombo’s existing debt with China as a pressure point. Since Sri Lanka’s largest creditor is China, the dynamics of this relationship will be particularly significant. To conclude, given that President Dissanayake has hardly completed two weeks in office, it will be too early to predict his foreign policy outlook. Still, learning from his past engagements with India and China in his political capacity, his presidency could herald a similar balancing act. He is likely to avoid skewing Sri Lanka’s foreign policy in favour of China at the expense of India, aiming for a more nuanced approach that fosters cooperation with both countries. Meanwhile, President Dissanayake’s visit to India will be a catalyst in defining the future course of the bilateral ties.

      "content": "Many college and university administrators eloquently defend academic freedom until they sense that this devotion to principle might place major monetary donations in jeopardy. This appears to have been the case when Muhlenberg College caved to outside pressure and fired tenured anthropology professor Maura Finkelstein for criticizing Israel’s policy in Gaza. This shameful decision violates the college’s most fundamental principle of academic freedom and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has opened an inquiry into Finkelstein’s dismissal. Gary Olson Bethlehem The writer is professor emeritus of political science, Moravian University. Edward P. Morgan Tamworth, N.H. The writer is professor emeritus of government, Lehigh University. On Monday, Oct. 7, 2024, at 7 p.m., the Allentown Zoning Hearing Board is scheduled to hold a hearing regarding the development of a trucking terminal at Union Terrace off Fairview and St. Elmo streets. The owners of the property wish to open a 24/7 terminal for tractor-trailers in the lot adjacent to the Union Terrace ballfields, Union Terrace Elementary School and just 100 yards from Cedar Creek, in an area zoned as park land. The residents of Union Terrace as well as Hamilton Park and Lehigh Parkway will be exposed to increased semi traffic, thunderous noise, diesel fumes and bright lights all night if the board allows this. I urge everyone to attend the hearing or, at minimum, send an email to the board by 4 p.m. Monday stating your objections to this abomination. Richard D. Gorski, Esq. Allentown Scientists have long known what is causing the rise in global temperatures and thanks to the Lehigh Valley Planning Commission’s recent report, we know what our share of the problem is. But while the problem of greenhouse gas emissions is worldwide, the U.S. has still not taken significant steps to ameliorate our nation’s share of that pollution. The climate deniers in Congress, beholden to fossil fuel interests, refuse to acknowledge that action must be taken to stave off future climate disasters of more severe drought, hurricanes, flooding, wildfires and tornadoes that are happening all over the world. Congresswoman Susan Wild has long been a climate champion and an advocate for the environment by supporting meaningful, bipartisan legislation to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas pollution and increase use of alternative energy sources. As the world’s largest per-capita emitter of greenhouse gasses, the U.S. needs to take swift and strong steps to cut our greenhouse gas output. Congress needs to recognize the problem and find solutions that will reduce fossil fuel use and bolster our electrical grid, which will also improve health and create jobs. As the report’s authors said, “inaction is not an option.” John Gallagher Bethlehem Township Since 35% of Pennsylvania voters cited the economy and inflation as the most important issue in this election, let’s compare the two presidential candidates. Donald Trump recently announced he’d slap tariffs (a national sales tax) on everyday goods that families rely on, with or without the help of Congress, raising costs on typical middle-class families by nearly $4,000 a year, according to some estimates. Experts warn that Trump’s economic plans would cost America millions of jobs, explode the national debt, send inflation skyrocketing, and cost as much as $10.5 trillion over a decade, hurting everyone but the richest Americans. The Project 2025 agenda (which he disclaims, but was created by many of his former advisers) would privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could, based on a 2015 study, drive up the cost of mortgages by about $1,200 a year for the typical family. It’s a stark contrast with Vice President Harris, who is focused on building up the middle class and lowering costs for families. Her plan would lower the costs of everyday needs like health care, housing and groceries, cut taxes for more than 100 million Americans, and create an opportunity economy where, with hard work and ambition, everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed, from buying a home to starting a business and building wealth. Lori McFarland Upper Milford Township The writer is the Lehigh County Democratic Committee Chair. I have to question the coverage of The Morning Call on the ongoing presidential race. In the Sept. 26 edition there was an article on the front page that covered new polls out in Pennsylvania. The article covered both candidates. The next article, which appeared a few pages later, was an article on Donald Trump’s deportation plan. Then a few pages later there was an article on how JD Vance embraces conspiracy theories. There was no mention of the economic address Kamala Harris gave Sept. 25 at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh. I find it ironic how the article about the new polls on the front page has the economy listed as “top of mind for Pennsylvania voters this election cycle.” We hear so much about undecided voters needing more information on where the candidates stand. I would have thought it would be responsible journalism to have information about the address in the paper. Michael Mowad Weisenberg Township Congresswoman Susan Wild is running for reelection. She has proven herself to be an effective leader for the Lehigh Valley. She has helped obtain funding for many of the road and bridge projects that are being done around the area. As a child of a military family, she understands and fully supports military and veterans issues and projects. She fought to lower insulin costs. She and Sen. Bob Casey obtained more than $950,000 in grants for the Allentown Police Department for new cruisers and updated crime scene equipment. She voted for the bipartisan border bill and wants a secure border. I first met Susan before she became our congresswoman. My first impression of her was that she had integrity and was a good person. I met her several times since then. I believe in her just as much now as I did then. Character matters! Please vote to reelect Congresswoman Susan Wild.

The initiative was split among party lines. While Makhija and Winder, both Democrats, were in favor of it, Republican Commissioner Tom DiBello voted against the purchase. “I don’t understand why we’re moving forward with this. It’s a large expenditure item for something quite honestly I feel we don’t need,” DiBello said during an August county commissioners meeting. Winder countered, asserting that the initiative increases accessibility in the weeks leading up to the 2024 general election. “The thought of being able to go to nursing homes, or the thought of being able to go to college campuses, and a wide range of community events, I think is the right thing for us to do,” she said. Engagement measures were being ramped up in Montgomery County nearly a month before Election Day. Voters are able to cast their ballots by mail, absentee ballot or in person at the polls. Montgomery County’s drop boxes and satellite offices opened on Friday, Oct. 4. “Election Day starts today, and it’s every day until Nov. 5,” Makhija said during a Sept. 17 press conference detailing preparation and security measures related to the 2024 general election.

September figures from the Pennsylvania Department of State recorded more than 600,000 people registered to vote in Montgomery County. Citing figures from prior election summary reports, a 68.49 percent voter turnout rate was recorded in 2022 and an 84.27 percent in 2020 , the last presidential election between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Voters have until Oct. 21 to register to vote and those voting by mail need to request their mail-in ballot by Oct. 29. Montgomery County will have 426 polling places set up for Election Day. The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 5. All ballots must be returned by the time the polls close, at 8 p.m. on Nov. 5.

Wear sunblock (and/or bring rain gear), drink often to avoid dehydration, bring money, wear good shoes or sandals, and sit down to rest often. A key strategy is to be open to new experiences, such as the new foods. I personally don’t like most of them (too spicy or weird) or the rides (EEEEEEEE!), though I did try the Afro Poppers, Lady’s Slipper Marble Sundae, Swedish Ice Cream Sundae, Peanut Butter Bacon Cakes (quite good), and Wrangler Waffle Burger.

I was on the Sky Glider on the first day, when it began raining in late morning. The rain was light enough that I hoped it would stop after a short time. It did not. When the Sky Glider stopped briefly, I asked someone going the other way where they had gotten their poncho. They told me and even pointed helpfully.

Floyd Olson commissioned such a statue. “I was able to see and photograph Floyd this year at the U of M building at the State Fair, during one of his rare visits to our state. It was more lifelike than I had expected. “Don’t bother looking for Floyd at the 2025 State Fair. He’ll still be in Iowa, following the 2024 game. “Despite all the publicity Floyd gets every year, it wasn’t until this year that I found out who the sculptor was who created Floyd. He was an Italian-American artist named Carlo Brioschi who had a studio in Saint Paul in the 1930s. His name seemed very familiar. I finally realized that Brioschi also created the statue of Christopher Columbus that stood on the grounds of the State Capitol from 1931 to 2020. I guess that makes him Floyd’s older brother. “Fortunately I took photos of Chris before he vanished from the face of the earth.” Now & Then JOHN IN HIGHLAND: “Subject: What goes around comes around. “On October 5, the University of Southern California football team returned to Minnesota for the first time in over 40 years. The Gophers put up a good fight back then, but lost, so this was a long-delayed chance for payback. “Quiz: Who was the Gopher quarterback in 1980? “Clue No. 1: He ran what was called the ‘Run and Shoot’ offense. “Clue No. 2: His dad was the coach.” BULLETIN BOARD NOTES: You’ll find the answer at the end of today’s BB. Our trees, ourselves — Or: Till death us do part HINDSIGHT: “Yesterday I went outside and walked to the end of our long driveway — a little shaky, but without my walker. I walked to the highway and turned back toward the house. In July, the electric company cut down 23 pines whose branches were too close to the power lines. We had known for a long time what the destiny of those trees would be. They had already been heavily trimmed twice over the years. I took the slaughter of those beautiful pines with grace and understanding, because as the electric company pointed out, this was for the electrical needs of everyone. I know, but still . . . “We planted those trees 49 years ago. Our children had their own special trees and were photographed as they and their special trees grew taller. We had not planted the trees under the power lines, but not back far enough. The trees’ only error was that they grew so tall — 45 feet tall and still reaching for the sky. The company left a few remaining, not a problem yet. A neighbor had hauled the cut trees away. Did we ever think that 49 years later, the power company would still be hanging electric wires on wooden poles? No, it never crossed our minds. “Anyone can see I’m over it now. “Walking back toward the house, I looked toward the south and noticed an 18-inch-tall Norway pine to my right, set farther back, many feet from the power lines. I stopped on the road. Dare I walk off the road down onto the rough ground? I wanted to touch that young tree with its soft needles and lovely color. Then I scanned beyond that little tree, and I could see a whole line of them spread an equal distance apart and set back from the electric lines. I walked carefully and slowly toward them. I touched and stroked every one. There were 12 of them, roughly the same size and obviously planted. Sunlight landed on the; the trees that were gone would not block the sunlight so necessary for them to thrive. The loss of the original trees is there in me, but here were their babies, ready to take the place of their missing parents. “I went back to the house to find Grumpus. ‘I found the trees. Why didn’t you tell me what you were doing? How long has this been going on?’ “Grumpus smiled. ‘I’ve been doing this for three years. If I found a baby, I would let it grow maybe a year and then transplant it. During the last two drought years, I would go and water them all when you took your afternoon nap.’ “This is love. Trying to fix something that meant a great deal to his partner and to him. Knowing how much this hurt my heart. Not candlelight dinners for two old duffers plodding along, but an act of kindness so needed, especially during rough times. I am not a baby, but I cried yesterday for 12 proud little Norway pines all in a row, and for their tree farmer.” Then & Now THE HAPPY MEDIUM: “Subject: Do You Remember When . . . ? “. . . Monday was THE wash day for mothers across America? I do. “We five children were off to school before Mom began sorting the laundry, whites to darks, on the kitchen floor. She started by heating water on the wood-fired cook stove before she went to the barn to milk cows. “Mom used the trusty Maytag clothes washer with an attached wringer. She filled the washer with the hot water and soap and placed the sorted white clothes in the water first. With those washed, she rinsed them, put them through the wringer, and carried them in her basket to the clotheslines set between the trees. This she did with each load of clothes until the very last was washed. Between loads, she drained the dirty water in buckets and dumped it outside, then added fresh hot water to the machine for the next load of wash. Realize, she had to keep the stove going to heat the water. She carried in the wood and plunked another stick in the stove to heat the water. She followed this procedure spring, summer, fall, and winter, come rain or shine, with no air conditioning in the summer. “Of course, wash day wasn’t the only task needing tending to. There were meals to prepare, bread to bake and maybe even a cake to bake. You get the idea: She was a master multitasker long before the term became the well used phrase of today. “When we came home from school, the clothes were off the kitchen floor, and the last load of overalls was in the wash. “By supper time, the meal she had prepared was ready. We children had the TASK of setting the table. We ate heartily whatever was set before us, and it was always so good. “Just wondering, dear reader: Today, what do you do each Monday? “Makes you wonder, doesn’t it.” The Kid and the kid BIG EEK of Southeast Minneapolis: “Subject: Billy the Kid. “The first book I ever read outside of school was a Big Little Book called ‘Billy the Kid.’ BLBs cost 15 cents. The copyright date is 1935, so I would have been 8 years old. That led to a lifelong interest in Billy. “Jump ahead a few years, to 1943. A movie came out about Billy. It was called ‘The Outlaw.’ It starred a young actor, Jack Buetel, as Billy, and 19-year-old Jane Russell as his romantic partner. The movie was made by Howard Hughes. Jane was a discovery of Howard’s, and this was her first movie. Jane’s claim to fame was her abundant bosom. “There were some steamy scenes between Jack Buetel and Jane Russell in the movie. Of course Billy has to die in the end: ‘shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend,’ as the song goes. But before that, the film is kind to Billy and shows the extenuating circumstances that led to his death — namely, his attempt to avenge the brutal murder of his employer, rancher John Tunstall, by a sheriff’s posse. “Billy’s friend Pat Garrett was elected Sheriff of Lincoln County in New Mexico. Lincoln is now a ghost town. The Middle Daughter and I visited it. Thomas Mitchell played Pat Garrett in the movie. “Billy had become a renegade cow thief by this time. Every hand was against him — including that of the wealthiest rancher in New Mexico, John Chisum. Billy had once worked for Chisum. “The Catholic Church had a list called The Index. On this list were books that Catholics were forbidden to read. Some movies were on the list, too. One was ‘The Outlaw.’ What should EEK have done? Go to the movie or skip it? What do you think EEK did? “So how did the movie end? [Bulletin Board interjects: 81-year-old Spoiler directly ahead!] Billy didn’t really die, but escaped to Mexico with Jane. (You know who I mean.) Pat had arranged a fake burial so that Billy and Jane could live out their lives in peace. “Oops! I’ve given it away. I did go to the movie — regardless of how it will affect my final resting place, up above or down below. “You technocrats can call up the movie and enjoy it. “WARNING: I’ll wait for you down below. We’ll have a good visit.” Hmmmmmmmm — Including: The highfalutin pleasures GEEZ LOUISE of the West Side reports: “I had just wheeled my cart out into the parking lot, to load my purchases into my car, when a bee settled on the handle of the cart. It looked different from the bees I usually see around the gardens in my neighborhood. It had a shiny black abdomen. I found my phone and did a search on ‘bee with a shiny black abdomen.’ “The search result told me it was a carpenter bee. “Of course it was. I was in the parking lot at Menards.” BAND NAME OF THE DAY: The Afro Poppers The Gophers’ QB in 1980 was Tim Salem (son of Joe) Your stories are welcome. The address is BB.onward@gmail.com .",

      "description": "The ideological seeds of extremism are planted long before college — and usually paid for with public tax dollars.",
      "content": "Monday marks the first anniversary of the Hamas slaughter of 1,300 innocent civilians in Israel. Yet as shocking as that attack was to the human conscience, the subsequent reaction to the massacre may be a more widespread and terrifying legacy. The victim-blaming began almost immediately, as student groups at elite universities published florid diatribes downplaying the attack while the tortured bodies of women, children and the elderly were still being identified. Columbia University students trumpeted “a counter-offensive” against Israel, the Palestinians’ “settler-colonial oppressor.” At Harvard, a consortium of 31 student groups said they “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.” Campus protests metastasized rapidly nationwide, with pro-Hamas demonstrators regularly invoking blood libel, the Holocaust and the elimination of the Jewish state. But how did this prejudice go from zero to 60 seemingly overnight? Is there something about the American college experience that transforms students into antisemites when they move into their freshman dorms? Radical professors and social media have played a role in fomenting this hatred. But in truth, the ideological seeds of extremism were planted long before freshman orientation — and usually paid for with public tax dollars. Bigotry is not innate; it is learned. And what has unfolded in higher education is the culmination of lessons taught during our students’ K-12 years, by elementary and high-school educators who have allowed antisemitism to flourish under the banner of progressive ideals. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives and ethnic studies curricula bear much of the blame. These programs teach children to categorize people as either “oppressed” or “oppressor,” assigning moral value based on characteristics like race, religion, immigration status and sexual preference. They have conditioned our students to view society through the lens of constant conflict and subjugation, as they push harmful stereotypes of collective guilt and innocence. Under the warped nature of this framework, Jews are coded as “privileged” because they are considered “white” — ignoring thousands of years of violent persecution as well as basic facts (almost 30% of the global Jewish population is non-white). Race should not matter at all, of course, but it seems cruelty is appropriate when directed at deserving targets. Examples abound of antisemitic rhetoric being not only tolerated in K-12 classrooms, but encouraged. In New Jersey, the Passaic County Education Association held a “summer series” designed to arm teachers with pro-Palestinian propaganda for the classroom. One lesson glorified “heroic resistance to Zionism” — the very language terrorists use as they slaughter Israeli innocents. Ethnic studies consultants advising school districts in California and Arizona have promoted “Preparing to Teach Palestine” toolkits, which instruct that Jews stole Israel from Palestinians, while the Qatar Foundation has provided teachers with maps that omit Israel from the Middle East altogether. Last year teachers in Oakland, Calif. held an unsanctioned “teach-in” to create a publicly available teaching guide on “the liberation of Palestine” that my group, Parents Defending Education, has since uncovered in other districts nationwide. In Oregon this spring, the Portland teachers’ union was caught promoting pro-Palestinian material intended for students as young as kindergarteners that describes Israelis as “colonial settlers” and labels their government as an “apartheid regime.” Other pamphlets in the collection go even further, referring to Hamas — a designated terrorist group — as a “Palestinian Resistance Force.” In New York City, a teacher pushed anti-Israel propaganda on children as young as 4 with lessons on “ land theft, displacement, and ethnic cleansing ,” while in Maryland, a middle school teacher celebrated as a “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion team leader” was suspended (though later reinstated) for posting online that the Oct. 7 attack was a hoax and accusing Israelis of harvesting Palestinians’ organs. The hateful response from American youth to the Oct. 7 massacre is gut-wrenching, but — considering what impressionable students are absorbing from trusted authority figures — perhaps unsurprising. It is clearer than ever that far too many school administrators and teachers have twisted their privilege as educators into a tool for indoctrinating kids into an ideological agenda that fuels hate, rather than combats it. After a year of once-unthinkable displays of Jew hatred and terror glorification, it is past time for elected officials at the local, state and federal levels to treat these incidents with the same gravity they do other forms of discrimination — and to attack the problem at its true source.

      "content": "October 06, (THEWILL) – The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Bola Tinubu “to direct Mr Olawale Edun, Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, to immediately withhold federal allocations to states that have failed and refused to conduct credible local government elections and to ensure that any allocations from the Federation Account is paid only to democratically elected local government councils and no other body or institution.” SERAP in a letter dated October 5, 2024, and signed by its deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare, also urged the President “To provide details of the number of local government councils that have directly received federal allocations and whether the councils are democratically elected, as provided for by the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended] and ordered by the Supreme Court in its judgment of July 11, 2024. “To promptly invite the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), to jointly track and monitor the spending of FAAC allocations by democratically elected local government councils across the country.” It told President Tinubu that his “Government has the obligation to enforce the Nigerian Constitution and to prevent public wrong, including by state governors. A democratically elected local government council does not and should not exist at the pleasure, whims and caprice of governors or their political godfathers. “Your government also has the constitutional obligation to ensure accountability for the spending of federal allocations and immediate compliance with the judgment by the Supreme Court and the rule of law.” The letter, reads in part: “Local government councils are entitled to a direct payment from the Federation Account to promote good governance, people’s welfare and development of local government areas across the country. “Where the rule of law reigns, political expediency ought to be sacrificed on the altar of the rule of law so as to guarantee the continued existence of institutions created to promote social values of liberty, orderly conduct and development. “We would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest. “It will be entirely consistent with the rule of law to immediately withhold federal allocations to states that have failed and/refused to conduct local government elections and to ensure that any allocations from the Federation Account are paid only to democratically elected councils and no other body or institution. “According to our information, the Supreme Court of Nigeria recently ordered the Federal Government to forthwith directly pay funds in the Federation Account only to democratically elected local government councils and no other body or institution. “The court also ordered the 36 state governors to ‘ensure democratic governance at the local government level. “The court ruled that state governors have no power to dissolve democratically elected local government councils within their states and replace the councils with caretaker committees. The court also made ‘an order of immediate compliance by states with the terms of this judgment. “According to our information, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu recently stated that ‘the conduct of Local Government elections in virtually all the States of the Federation has become mere coronation of candidates of the ruling parties. It is time to stop the coronation and conduct proper elections. “SERAP is concerned that local government elections in several states are susceptible to manipulation by governors and other actors. “SERAP is concerned that several state governors are failing to organise local government council elections, contrary to section 7(1) of the Nigerian Constitution. “SERAP is also concerned about the allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the spending by governors of federal allocations meant for the local government councils in their states. Trillions of FAAC allocations received by Nigeria’s 36 states have allegedly gone down the drain. “The resulting human costs directly threaten the human rights of socially and economically vulnerable Nigerians. “Despite the increased allocation from FAAC, millions of residents in several states continue to face extreme poverty and lack access to basic public goods and services. “The reported removal of petrol subsidy and the flotation of the naira by the Federal Government has translated into increased FAAC allocations to states and the FCT. However, there is no corresponding improvement in the security and welfare of millions of Nigerians. “SERAP notes that Section 162(3)(5) of the Nigerian Constitution provides that the amount standing to the credit of local government councils in the Federation Account shall be distributed to them and be paid directly to them. “State governors have no power to keep, control, manage or disburse in any manner allocations from the Federation Account to local government councils. “By the terms of the Supreme Court judgment, the 36 state governors are restrained from further collecting, receiving, spending or tampering with local government council funds from the Federation Account for the benefit of local government councils. “SERAP notes that section 165 of the Nigerian Constitution and the Allocation of Revenue Act No.1 1982, stipulate that the revenues generated by the government should be credited into the federation account and disbursed monthly among the federal government, states and local governments. “SERAP notes that former president Muhammadu Buhari had in December 2022 stated that, ‘If the money from the Federation Account to the State is about N100m, N50m will be sent to the chairman but he will sign that he received N100 million. The chairman will pocket the balance and share it with whoever he wants to share it with. “According to Buhari, ‘If the money from the Federation Account to the State is about N100 million, N50 million will be sent to the chairman but he will sign that he received N100 million. The chairman will pocket the balance and share it with whoever he wants to share it with. “The 36 states in Nigeria and the federal capital territory, Abuja, have reportedly collected over N40 trillion federal allocations meant for the 774 local governments areas in the country and FCT. “The Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC), disbursed to states N225.21 billion federal allocations meant for local governments in November 2023 alone. States also collected N258,810,449,711.47 federal allocations meant for local government areas in December 2023.”",

      "description": "A new book explores how an irrational hatred of Israel led the left to betray its most deeply held values following the October 7 massacre",
      "content": "Hamas’s October 7 massacre was shocking, not just due to its barbarity, but the reaction it elicited on the streets of liberal democracies, with masses of westerners actively cheering on the slaughter of innocent civilians and siding with a genocidal terrorist organization. As the first anniversary of that horrific day approaches, a new book sheds light on the morally bankrupt ideology that has caused many of our elites to turn their backs on liberal values and forge an unholy alliance with religious extremists. “The Jewish nation found itself subjected to the very butchery it was built to withstand. The state to which Jews fled to escape the pogroms was now besieged by a pogrom. It felt like the most grave of violations, both of the sanctuary of the Jews and of the pact humankind made in the aftermath of the last great war: Never Again,” writes British author and commentator Brendan O’Neill in his new book, “ After the Pogrom : 7 October, Israel and the Crisis of Civilisation.” “And yet that shining moral clarity never came.... Too many had taken up the cause not of the Jews, but of their persecutors.” O’Neill believes that October 7 provided a “moral test” for western civilization, and we failed it miserably. He rightly places much of the blame for this on modern progressive ideology, which is a complete bastardization of the values that liberals once held dear. “The barbarous dearth of sympathy for the dead and raped of Israel is the logical inhumane conclusion to a pseudo-progressive politics that judges people’s moral worth by their skin colour, their presumed privilege and their placement on a racial hierarchy fashioned by the unaccountable overlords of western opinion,” writes O’Neill. The book deftly exposes the hypocrisy of the anti-Israel left, showing how progressives have betrayed the cultural mores they spent the better part of two decades trying to impose on the rest of society. In a chapter about the response of many feminist organizations to the mass sexual violence that took place on October 7, for example, O’Neill laments how quickly the #MeToo mantra of “believe all women” was thrown out the window when images of female hostages with bloodstained sweatpants and corpses with underwear around their ankles started appearing on our screens. Not only did many feminists ignore or downplay the atrocities, some pretended the whole thing was fabricated to make Hamas look bad. And this is from a crowd that spent years telling us that something as innocuous as a flirtatious glance or a hug in the workplace was evidence of “rape culture” run amok. “Far be it from me to mansplain,” writes O’Neill, “but if the thought of a hand brushing a knee unsettles you more than the sight of Shani Louk’s battered body being spat on and hit with sticks by a mob of violent racists, it’s possible you are doing feminism wrong.” Elsewhere in the book, he wonders, “Whatever happened to the sin of cultural appropriation?” It wasn’t long ago when progressives were actively policing Halloween costumes, authors were being chastised for writing about the experiences of other races and left-wing media outlets were publishing “Dear white people” stories warning them not to wear dreadlocks or use Black slang. Yet visit any campus nowadays and you’re likely to see hordes of white kids dressed as Arabs. “It is striking that the liberal establishment’s patrician ‘Dear White People’ missives dried up completely in the face of the latest keffiyeh craze,” writes O’Neill. Today, “Keffiyeh chic is all the rage.” In another chapter on the irrational hatred that many have toward the Jewish state, O’Neill argues that the worst mass-murder of Jews since the Holocaust “seems like something the anti-racists of the West should condemn. And yet their first instinct in the wake of the pogrom was to protest against the victim of that violent orgy of bigotry, not its perpetrators.” How did we get to a point where a supposed anti-war movement is preaching violence; where self-styled “anti-racists” are espousing antisemitism; where so-called anti-fascists are actively supporting Islamofascists; where feminists are turning a blind eye toward mass rape and defending some of the most misogynistic regimes on the planet; and where LGBTQ activists are advocating for governments that criminalize homosexuality? O’Neill devotes an entire chapter to the “perverse political marriage between secular leftists and the religious extremists of radical Islam,” arguing that, “It was the left’s turn against the principles of Enlightenment that made it so lethally susceptible to the ‘charms’ of radical Islam. “Having replaced class politics with identity politics, and its old anti-capitalism with a myopic anti-westernism, and its one-time commitment to civilizational ideals with a heavy-hearted angst over the ‘sins’ of our civilization, the left found itself drawn ever closer to those other haters of everything the West stands for: Islamists.” He traces this unholy alliance to a 1994 pamphlet written by socialist thinker Chris Harman, who admitted, as O’Neill puts it, that “Islamism at times has the whiff of fascism to it,” but nevertheless argued that it could be “tapped for progressive purposes.” Over time, Harman’s warnings about Islamism’s fascistic tendencies were forgotten, and replaced with a prohibition against criticizing other cultures, especially non-white ones, which protects Islam from progressive critique. “It’s a lesson as old as time,” writes O’Neill, “make a deal with the devil and the devil will always win. A left that thought it could make just the occasional alliance with fascism now finds itself at the service of fascism, dutifully doing Hamas’s and Hezbollah’s bidding on the streets of our cities.” One aspect of the book I particularly admire is that, while it is primarily focused on the scourge of antisemitism, O’Neill rarely uses the term in his writing. Instead, he systematically debunks the lies and misinformation being spread by the Israel-haters, and clearly illustrates why the only conclusion to draw from their singular focus on the Jewish state is that they are motivated by hate. Take, for example, the left’s criticism of Zionism. O’Neill correctly notes that criticizing Israel is not inherently racist and that Zionism has been the subject of much historical debate, mainly among Jewish people themselves. But while past critiques of Zionism were wrapped up in broader critiques of nationalism, modern anti-Zionists are solely focused on Jewish nationalism. “Why have they never gone out in public to demand death for Lithuanian nationalists, for instance? Or to damn Italian nationalists as ugly and cancerous?” asks O’Neill. “The very potency of the rage against Zionism, the singular, furious nature of it, is an indictment of its bigotry and irrationalism.... “This is not criticism — it is hysteria. It is not opposition — it is hatred. It is not even denunciation — it is a death sentence for Jewish nationalism and Jewish nationalism alone.” This has led to the “re-emergence of old hatreds in new language,” with Islamists, progressives and neo-Nazis having replaced the word “Jews” with “Zionists,” but espousing the same bigoted tropes of centuries past. “What has happened, it seems to me, is that the old dread and prejudice for Jews is now projected on to the Jewish state,” argues O’Neill. Anti-Zionism “is the form that Jew scapegoating takes in the 21st century. Where once people pinned their community’s every trouble on the Jews in their midst, now people hold Israel responsible for the ills not only of the Middle East, but of the West, of the world, too.” The irony, O’Neill correctly states, is that anti-Zionism is “proof of why Zionism is necessary.... No more justification for Israel’s existence is necessary than the fact that so many wish to bring Israel crashing down.” I would recommend “After the Pogrom” to anyone looking to get a fuller understanding of how woke progressivism has enabled the re-emergence and normalization of antisemitism and provided cover for western elites to side with theocratic mass murders. It is also a great resource for anyone on the left who’s willing to challenge their worldview. It should be included among the mandatory reading material on university syllabuses, if only to force students, and their professors, to examine their belief systems and confront whether their hatred toward Israel has created a blind spot that has allowed them to violate all the values they claim to hold dear.

      "content": "This has been a news-heavy week. A journalist hardly knows what to cover and at what length: the horrific devastation of Hurricane Helene; the gradual shift of a war between mid-eastern proxies to direct attacks between Israel and Iran; or the vice-presidential debate between J.D. Vance and Tim Walz. The latter was an unusually courteous encounter with exchanges that actually dealt with specific topics. But what counts in the political show biz of television is appearance and, on that level, Vance clearly was the winner. True, he repeated some of Trump’s more outrageous lies, but in a calm and sincere manner. It was rather like watching a TV drug commercial in which viewers are so distracted by the sight of happy, enthusiastic users that they miss the disclaimer about possibly lethal side effects. It was the best thing that has happened to the Trump campaign since the GOP’s nominating convention. The former president gave Vance a glowing internet review, but the general consensus that he lost to Harris, while Vance overshadowed Walz, has to sting. Trump cannot stand being upstaged by an underling. While Harris has pragmatically changed her views on several topics, Vance’s reversal on Trump has been head-spinning. After blasting Trump as another Hitler, he now promotes his lies about winning in 2020 and echoes his irrational rants against immigrants, albeit in more measured speech. “Establishment” Republicans detest Trump, but they need his followers‘ votes. When Trump is finally off the stage, Vance is well positioned to replace him. He’s well connected with the money wing of the party and might be able to hold on to MAGA zealots. He is clearly looking ahead to a presidential run of his own. --- The spreading war in the Middle East can be traced to the fatal mistake of rejecting the two-state solution of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Benyamin Netanyahu’s early decision to undercut the Accords and pursue power at all costs lie at the base of the escalating violence. Now we see how his relentless drive to stay in power is playing out. The periodic bursts of violence of both sides has escalated to tit-for-tat exchanges between Iran and Israel that seem to be triggering a full-scale war. Netanyahu knows that he has a free hand to exploit American military aid until Nov. 5th. Democrats and Republicans have their eye on the Jewish vote and don’t want to do anything which might tilt that fractured bloc one way or the other in the election. A lengthy, mid-week Washington Post story by reporters Karen DeYoung and Missy Ryan details Biden’s long, frustrating attempt to moderate Netanyahu’s aggressive tactics; “(Biden) made clear our support (for Israel) was unqualified, the morally right thing to do,\" recalled David Satterfield, a senior U.S. diplomat with long Middle East experience, whom Biden called out of retirement to manage the looming humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. “But the president also ‘made it clear’ to Netanyahu that ‘you’ve got to treat the humanitarian side of this with as much seriousness as the kinetic side,’ \" Satterfield said. 'Were maximum efforts made by Israel? No. They were not then and they certainly are not now.’ ” Netanyahu continues to insist on U.S. arms supplies to carry out his war of Hamas and Hezbollah extermination, dismissive of the cost to innocent civilians. Demands for temperance from Biden and the U.N. are simply ignored. After the election, President Biden will have two months in which to take more drastic action to stop the carnage, if he wishes. By then, it may be too late to halt a wider conflagration. --- It may also be too late to mitigate the increasing damage induced by our changing climate. The devastating destruction wrought by hurricane Helene is emblematic of what we can expect from this point on. Changes are in motion across the world that won’t be stopped, even we could shut down fossil fuel emissions overnight. Glaciers are melting in Greenland, The huge Thwaites glacier in Antarctica is sliding into the sea and frozen tundra is melting across vast areas of Siberia and North America: all releasing vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Nothing we do now can halt any of this. Helene was unprecedented. It formed off the coast of central America, moved across the Gulf of Mexico in a week, slamming into the Florida coast as a category 4 storm over 400 miles wide. It maintained hurricane strength well inland, pouring over 20 inches of rain and 100-mph winds into areas that had never expected to suffer such damage. National and state resources were overwhelmed. There are still remote areas in North Carolina and Tennessee that can only be reached by helicopter. The six-state death toll continues to rise and many are still unaccounted for. Few homes in the region had national flood insurance. The effects of this catastrophe will linger far into the future. Among the many economic impacts of the storm is the shutdown of factories in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, noted for the production of rare, high-purity quartz used to make solar panels and computer chips. While the factories may be up and running again soon, unnumbered homes - even wholesale villages - have been lost. Meanwhile record temperatures are being registered on the west coast, the mountain states, and in Texas and Florida. Triple digit readings are becoming common. As the Earth continues to heat up, weather patterns are changing in deadly, unanticipated ways. Here in the Midwest, we are in a drought, with its attendant warning of fire hazard. While the frequency of tornadoes has increased, we have largely avoided the fires and floods that have plagued other parts of the nation. Being temporarily in the sweet spot can be seductive, making us complacent; but our turn will come. Don Wooten Don Wooten is a former Illinois state senator and a regular columnist.

      "description": "The revision lowers the threshold of use of nuclear weapons by Russia. It is a warning to the West not to escalate the Ukraine war",
      "content": "The Ukraine conflict is acquiring increasingly dangerous dimensions. The US is today engaged in an open proxy war against Russia by providing arms, training, intelligence, instructors and funds to Ukraine to sustain its conflict with Russia. The US has declared openly that its goal in the Ukraine conflict is to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, weaken it militarily to the point that it can no longer pose a threat to its neighbours, in the hope that this could lead eventually to a regime change in Russia. The US has applied the most draconian sanctions on Russia to cause its economic collapse. It has sought to isolate Russia diplomatically. It has manoeuvred to declare President Vladimir Putin a war criminal. This US/NATO strategy has not worked. The Russian economy has weathered the sanctions. After initial setbacks, the Russian army has recovered ground. Russia has ramped up its production of war material. It has adapted its military response to new weapon technologies and advanced NATO arms and tactics employed against it. It has limited its war aims and used its military resources commensurately. Russia is not isolated diplomatically. Its strategic partnership with China has reached unprecedented levels. India is determined to preserve its traditional ties of trust and friendship with Russia and has resisted Western pressures to dilute ties with Moscow. Russia is today the biggest oil supplier to India. India has refused to condemn Russia for its military action in Ukraine and has abstained on UN Security Council and General Assembly resolutions against this intervention. India, and many countries of the global south as well, do not accept the Western narrative that Russia launched an “unprovoked war” in Ukraine. They understand the genesis of the conflict, of which NATO expansion has been a prime reason. They understand that if the Minsk agreement that were ratified by the UN Security Council had been implemented, or if the broad agreement reached by Russian and Ukrainian negotiators at Istanbul had not been opposed by the West, the conflict could have ended. Which is why, many in the global south do not accept the Western narrative on the Ukraine conflict and do not willingly adhere to Western sanctions. They participate in many events organised in Russia, and entertain many Russian delegations in their own countries. In the G20 New Delhi summit declaration, in the paragraph on the Ukraine conflict, Russia is not mentioned by name, which shows that the G20 members of the global south do not support the West’s one-sided position on Russia having sole responsibility for the Ukraine conflict. The expansion of BRICS with five additional members — Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, UAE and Ethiopia — indicates that the Western strategy to isolate Russia has dramatically failed, especially as some of these countries have close political, economic and defence ties with the US. Many global south countries — reportedly up to 30 — have applied for BRICS membership, including a NATO member like Turkey, with the next BRICS summit at Kazan in the offing. Many in the global south see Russia, the world’s largest country, possessing huge natural resources, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a formidable nuclear power, as pivotal to creating a multipolar order. Such an order alone will give a voice to the global south in international governance. The West has steadily escalated the military conflict in Ukraine by providing the Ukrainian armed forces with more and more lethal weapons to attack Russian targets. This has been done step by step to test the Russian red lines. It began with the supply of air defence systems, long range artillery, tanks, powerful cruise missiles, F16s, and so on. Russia has been warning against such stepped up supplies but has acted with restraint, without being distracted from its limited war aims. President Putin has, however, been warning the West that they must understand that Russia is a nuclear power and will defend itself if necessary with nuclear weapons if its very existence is threatened. He had in 2018 announced that Russia was developing a new ICBM missile and long range underwater drones against which the West had no defences. He has repeated this subsequently. Russia’s nuclear warnings have gone unheeded in the West. The belief there is that Russia is bluffing and that the West should not be deterred. In turn, western voices have warned that the West too possesses nuclear weapons, with commentators threatening to destroy Russia’s Black Sea if Russia used tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. France has offered access to its nuclear arsenal for Europe’s defence. Ukraine has been permitted to use NATO supplied weapons to attack the former Ukrainian territory now incorporated into Russia, as also the Russia fleet in the Black Sea which has suffered much damage. Ukraine has also used long range drones to attack targets deep into Russia. In August 2024, Ukraine intruded into Russia’s Kursk region, the first land invasion of Russia after that of Hitler. The symbolism of this invasion cannot be ignored by Russia. Ukraine is now lobbying the US and the EU for permission to attack Russia proper with the long range missiles supplied by the UK and the US. The UK is actively supporting this escalation while the US seems reticent for fear of triggering a direct conflict between Russia and NATO. Zelensky has just visited the US with his Victory Plan which is intended to draw NATO into the conflict. While this debate is going on in the West, President Putin has unveiled the revision of Russia’s nuclear doctrine which would allow a Russian nuclear response to a massive attack on its territory with missiles, drones, etc, with the support of a nuclear state. This lowers the nuclear threshold of use of nuclear weapons by Russia. It is a warning to the West not to escalate. There are voices in Russia, of well-established geo-politicians and conservative philosophers, that are advocating the use of nuclear weapons by Russia as the only way to deter the West. The fact is that so far Russia’s formidable nuclear arsenal has not deterred its adversaries from fighting a steadily intensifying open proxy war against it. Russia’s redlines have been repeatedly crossed by the West Russia has suffered in terms of considerable field losses and loss of prestige as well as it has not been able to achieve its war aims as quickly as it might have anticipated. The West, which has demonised Putin, sees his self-restraint as a sign of Russia’s weakness. This would explain why some prestigious figures in Russia advocate a real show of power by Russia by using nuclear weapons to deter the West from continuing to bleed it. The example of Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has shown the way to use unbridled force to achieve security goals without losing broad support in the global south, is apparently being cited by those in Russia who want a demonstration of nuclear power by Moscow. Whatever the West’s effort to demonise him, Putin is respected for his statesman-like qualities of maturity, restraint, moderation and self-control in the global south, in contrast to Western leaders with their warmongering discourse and refusal to explore dialogue and diplomacy as a path to peace in Ukraine. Putin’s position that he is ready for a dialogue on a realistic basis defuses the Western propaganda against him. However, it would be wrong to believe that Russia will not lose support in the global south if it used nuclear weapons. The abhorrence towards the use of nuclear weapons is deeply embedded in global public sentiment at large. Since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons have not been used. Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters show how much the public is terrified of the consequences of a nuclear fallout. These were accidents confined to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. A wilful use of nuclear weapons for war purposes is altogether different from a nuclear accident. Leave aside whether such use by Russia or any other country could lead eventually to the annihilation of the human race if a nuclear spiral follows, the country resorting first to a nuclear strike will be in the international dog house. Whichever that country, it will be condemned in the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly. even by its friends as they would not see the justification of using nuclear weapons to thwart a conventional attack. In Russia’s case, it would be seen as that much indefensible as it has not so far used the full panoply of its conventional arsenal against Ukraine. It needs recalling in this context that the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion in 1996 ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons “would generally be contrary” to humanitarian and other international law regulating the conduct of warfare. In addition, the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons which came into force in 2021 includes a comprehensive set of prohibitions on participating in any nuclear weapon activities. These include undertakings not to develop, test, produce, acquire, possess, stockpile, use or threaten to use nuclear weapons. If Russia, which has been a staunch supporter of the NPT, were to use nuclear weapons the non-proliferation regime will undoubtedly collapse. Most importantly, the G20 New Delhi Declaration, to which Russia is also a party, states that the “use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible”. Brazil and South Africa, as well as China, not to mention Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey, also endorsed this view. This will be the general view of the countries of the global south too, beyond the G 20. Russia cannot ignore the real possibility that the price it could pay in terms of the disruption of its ties to the global south across the board, including on the economic front, would be very considerable. Russia, already under pressure from the West, will come under pressure from the global south too. All said and done, it is not conceivable that Russia would use nuclear weapons unless its very existence is threatened. This proposition would be true of all countries that possess nuclear weapons, as the logic of possessing them is precisely to thwart any existential threat. If the debate over the use of nuclear weapons has started in Russia because of the declared objective of the West to impose a strategic defeat on it, with some in Europe openly talking of the break-up of the Russian federation, then the responsibility lies on the West to desist from fuelling the conflict in Ukraine to a point of no-return and instead exploring the route of dialogue and diplomacy to find a realistic solution.

      "description": "Of all the people I’ve had the privilege of interviewing over the past year or so, Dr Lynne Tammi-Connolly was one of the most impressive.",
      "content": "Of all the people I’ve had the privilege of interviewing over the past year or so, Dr Lynne Tammi-Connolly was one of the most impressive. Dr Connolly is the Scottish academic who, for many years, has sought redress for the thousands of Scottish children – mainly from the gypsy and gypsy traveller communities – who were trafficked from Scotland throughout the 20th century. It was one of the most shameful episodes in Scotland’s history and one which the Scottish Government and civic Scotland has repeatedly failed to acknowledge. In January of this year, Dr Connolly competed a two-week journey by foot from her home in Montrose to Holyrood to highlight her campaign. She had hoped to be met by Emma Roddick, Scotland’s Minister for Equalities, Migration and Refugees. Ms Roddick insisted she was unavailable, however. Only after some light arm-twisting by The Herald and Dr Connolly did Ms Roddick finally agree to meet with this stalwart academic. Even then, Dr Connolly was reminded quite firmly of the rules of engagement that govern how politics is conducted in modern Scotland. Put simply, she had to know her place in the grand scheme of things. In Scotland, unless you have a platinum card admitting access to Holyrood’s inner sanctum, then your place is on the bottom rung of society and you must wait in a long queue before the government’s courtiers and fluffers summon you. For Dr Connolly this meant being told only to speak when spoken to and only on pre-approved topics. “I’ve been told I won’t be permitted to discuss anything to do with the tinker gypsy experiments, the child trafficking or the prospect of an official apology,” she said. I mention this now only because Dr Connolly, along with other Scots “local heroes”, was treated once more with contempt and disdain at Holyrood last week at an event to mark 25 years of the Scottish Parliament. As the tribunes and trumpets of civic Scotland who have all fed richly on Holyrood’s largesse gathered to congratulate each other for their great good fortune, the real people who make this country work were shunted into Holyrood’s hidden vestibules lest they embarrass some of the political roasters taking selfies with each other. Many of these talentless and indolent chancers – mainly in the SNP and the Scottish Greens – have been embarrassing Scotland for the last 10 years. It’s they who should have been shunted into cupboards. (Image: Gordon Terris) Pub talk In a louche tavern on Glasgow’s eastern fastnesses last week, I was being urged to write an alternative guide to accessing political and civic power in modern Scotland. However, I’m not sure I’m the chap for the job. I’ve developed a deep loathing for the system and its serpentine rules that determine who gets heard in what we laughably call a liberal democracy. There are some decent and honest people at Holyrood who genuinely care about improving the lives of ordinary Scots, especially those who were born without the advantages many of the rest of us have. Sadly, they are currently swamped by a sprawling and shape-shifting class of political scavengers who know a good thing when they see it and quickly set about the task of grabbing a piece of the action. This mainly involves ditching any principles you might once have possessed and divining which organisations and individuals have the ear of the SNP leadership. Thereafter, you solicit informed opinion about the personal preferences and predispositions of the anointed and set about endorsing these on social media. Your conscience must only be formed by sticking your finger in the air to see which way the wind is blowing on the major issues of the day. Lobby woe ACCESS to Scotland’s power brokers is gained through a suite of shadowy and serpentine channels. It’s reserved to a chosen few. Many of these are employed by the lobbying firms who represent Scotland’s only real growth sector in the devolved era. These outfits occupy a treacherous terrain where the secret to success is to agree wholeheartedly with everything the First Minister and his Cabinet say. After all, of what use are you to your per diem corporate client base if you were ever to criticise those who hand out the big contracts, or who shape laws that may affect your customers’ business interests? In recent years, this hidden system of patronage has grown further tentacles with the emergence of Glasgow University’s John Smith Foundation. There’s also a John Smith Trust and a John Smith Centre. At any given time their boards comprise of a dizzying array of baronesses, and legal and academic panjandrums who have played the game successfully and the odd former politician who is deemed capable of walking and talking at the same time (admittedly, a narrow cohort). Their collective purpose is to source “exceptional” people who know how to behave themselves and look the other way when required. It’s summed up in this prospectus: “In cultivating an active network of Fellows, we motivate and stimulate action to progress shared values of tolerance, respect and openness, as well as governance that is rules-based and people-focused.” Loosely translated, this means: “Don’t rock the boat; speak nicely; ditch your beliefs; and you’ll be well looked after. A nod’s as good as a wink to a blind horse.” SPAD madness EVIDENCE of what rewards await those who do the political Hokey Cokey was provided last month by the publication of a lengthy and soporific document co-authored by Stephen Noon and Kezia Dugdale, the former I’m A Celebrity... contestant. It’s dozens of pages long and concludes that the Scottish Secretary should be handed new powers to call for a second referendum. The dogs on the streets know a referendum will never happen any time before Mr Noon and Ms Dugdale access their pensions. The report was published by Glasgow University’s Centre for Public Policy. Mr Noon was chief strategist for Yes in 2014 before lately occupying the never-never land of devo max and then alighting on whatever position his academic paper is supposed to represent. Until this month, he was a Glasgow University academic in that Centre for Public Policy. Ms Dugdale, until recently, was director of the John Smith Centre. He supported Kate Forbes in the SNP leadership before switching to John Swinney. This was a judicious choice. Last week, he was appointed one of Mr Swinney’s team of special advisers. “You put your left leg in, your left leg out In, out, in, out, shake it all about You do the hokey cokey and you turn around That’s what it’s all about.”",

      "content": "President Bola Tinubu on Saturday said Nigeria’s problems are so enormous that no one can phantom it unless he or she gets to the position of governing the country. He also added that he is currently not concerned about a reelection, but posterity and welfare of Nigerians. The President made this remarks during the All Progressives Congress (APC) South-West Zone Assembly on Saturday at Eko Hotels, Lagos, hosted by the Chairman of South West Governors’ Forum and Lagos Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The President was represented by his Chief of Staff, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, who assured that all deliberations by the South West caucus would be given adequate consideration, saying, “Even though he is President of Nigeria the South West remains his base”. Gbajabiamila added: “For those of us who know him very well, he has a love for the masses. As the people are complaining, he is also pained but when a man has a strong conviction of what he is doing, he pursues it relentlessly.” The Chief of Staff said the President is a listening leader who would continue to do the biddings of the people, while assuring the gathering of continuous engagement and advice for the President. Speaking, Host, the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu said, said: “We have come as one big family to explore and have more ways to work together. It is to share ideas and agree on strategies to take South West to greater heights. “We are blessed with assets and more positioned to move the country forward.” He urged participants to always be guided by the strong Omoluabi ethos for which the southwest region is noted, and leverage same to engender the progress of the region and the country. Sanwo-Olu also said that the gathering is to reinvigorate hope in people, saying the strong omoluabi ethos in the zone should He appealed to leaders and other members to keep supporting Tinubu, just as he added that the region should strive to forge ahead of 2027 election. Also speaking at the event, Dr. John Kayode Fayemi, former governor of Ekiti state, who delivered the keynote address said: “We in the South West zone should set an example by ensuring that the caucus is replicated at the national Assembly to the State and local government levels “We cannot continue to rest on our oars as a party, we should be ready to forge a united front. I am convinced that APC will remain strong to accomplish the unfinished business of the renewed hope agenda of Mr President.” Other State governors who attended the event included, Ekiti, Biodun Oyebanji, Ondo, Lucky Aiyedatiwa and Ogun, Dapo Abiodun. Leaders at the meeting included ex-interim National chairman, Bisi Akande, ex-Ogun Governors, Olusegun Osoba and Ibikunle Amosun, Lagos GAC leader, Tajudeen Olusi among others.

      "content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia say they will not back either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in next month's election because of both candidates' support of Israel amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Harris has said she supports Israel's right to defend itself and would not withhold weapons from the country, but has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza, while Trump said recently he is Israel's \"protector\" and reaffirmed his support for the Jewish state. In battleground Georgia, where Trump narrowly lost in 2020 to President Joe Biden, the Peach State could help determine whether Harris or Trump wins the presidency. The Muslim population in Georgia could also impact which candidate wins the state's 16 electoral votes. Muslim voters across the country are virtually tied between Harris and Trump, with Harris only securing a single-point advantage, according to a recent poll by the Arab American Institute . KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST A growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia say they will not back Vice President Harris or former President Trump over their support of Israel. (Getty Images) Kristen Truitt, a Muslim American voter in Atlanta, has voted for Democrats in prior elections but now says the party will not have his support over its position on Israel. \"Just to give unlimited funds and access to Israel, I think that is totally ridiculous,\" Truitt told Fox 5 Atlanta . This comes just ahead of the one-year mark of the ongoing war in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists. The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and took more than 250 hostages, which prompted retaliatory action from Israel's military. The Hamas-run government's Gaza Health Ministry estimates that more than 41,000 people have been killed in the conflict, although it does not distinguish between civilian and terrorist deaths. More than 1,500 people have reportedly been killed in Israel since the start of the conflict, with most of them being killed on Oct. 7 and its immediate aftermath. TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE Vice President Kamala Harris during a campaign event at the Philip Chosky Theatre in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024. (Rebecca Droke/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia and across the country have said they will not vote for Harris or Trump due to both sides' vocal support of Israel in its war in Gaza , and the conflict is now expanding to include Israel attacking Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon. \"What we're trying to say is we should really do away with the logic of voting for the 'lesser of two evils,'\" Kareem Rosshandler, Georgia co-chair of the \"Abandon Harris\" campaign, told Fox 5. The \"Abandon Harris\" campaign group is urging Muslims to vote third-party to send a message to Republicans and Democrats that they need to earn the votes of the Muslim community. \"I think the main one is to say that the Muslim community in the United States won't be taken for granted,\" Rosshandler said. Rosshandler said the group has already secured commitments from more than 10,000 Muslim voters to support third-party candidates. Some third-party candidates, including Libertarian Chase Oliver and the Green Party's Jill Stein, have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza. Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a town hall event in Fayetteville, N.C., Friday, Oct. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Karl B DeBlaker) The loss of Muslim voters is expected to hurt Harris more than Trump , as the Republican candidate has previously struggled to secure Muslim votes. \"That would essentially have a greater adverse impact on the Harris-Waltz ticket than it would on Trump-Vance,\" Emory University assistant professor of law Alicia Hughes, who is also a voting expert, told Fox 5 Atlanta. \"Trump, historically, has not been able to count on those votes.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hughes also says that if Harris or Trump were more vocally critical of Israel, it may not help their election chances either. \"There's a great possibility that you would lose more from the change than you would actually gain,\" she said.",

      "content": "Dubai brokers are charging an increased minimum commission from tenants for affordable properties under Dh100,000 annual rent as demand for rentals continues to grow at an exponential pace. Generally, commission accounts for 2 per cent of the sale value and 5 per cent of the annual rental, excluding 5 per cent value-added tax (VAT). “While the traditional 5 per cent commission applies across the board, its impact is felt differently depending on the property segment. In the luxury market, where annual rents often soar above Dh200,000, tenants typically pay only the standard commission,\" said Maria Selama, leasing consultant of Huspy. \"However, for those in the mid-market and affordable segments, things are shifting. Here, brokers are implementing a minimum commission fee of Dh5,000 for properties priced under Dh100,000. This can lead to higher effective rates for tenants in these categories,” she added. Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels. Explaining the scenario, Selama said, \"A tenant leasing an apartment for Dh70,000 would usually pay Dh3,500 in commission, but with the new minimum in place, they’ll pay the full Dh5,000, resulting in an effective commission of about 7.14 per cent. This change illustrates how tenants in more affordable segments are facing increased commissions, while those in the luxury segment continue to benefit from the traditional commission structure. As a result, it’s essential for renters to stay informed about these differences, as they can significantly affect overall rental costs.\" Rents have been on the rise in the post-pandemic period on the back of high demand from property buyers and new tenants coming to the country as strong GDP growth generates more employment opportunities in the country. According to real estate consultancy CBRE, the rate at which rents continue to grow remained unwavering, where average residential rents grew by 21.1 per cent in the year to June 2024. This increase has been driven by a 22.2 per cent growth in average apartment rents and a 12.7 per cent increase in average villa rents. Deepak Kripalani, founder and CEO of House2Home Real Estate, said the law says both the parties involved are to be charged equally. “As an agent, we need to balance the deal equally, however, there is no defined law of setting a particular percentage to charge.” Increased commissions Commissions paid by the tenants to brokerages have increased over the years due to a rise in rentals. Maria Selama of Huspy said landlords do not charge commissions from tenants, but brokers continue to apply the standard commission rate of 5 per cent. “Although this percentage remains unchanged, there is a perception among tenants that overall costs have risen due to increased rental prices in the market. As a result, while the commission percentage has not increased, tenants may feel the impact of higher rental rates on their overall housing expenses,” she stated. “A tenant renting a villa for Dh500,000 annually would pay Dh25,000 in brokerage fees, which is straightforward. However, tenants in the mid-market or affordable segments may end up paying a higher effective percentage due to the introduction of a minimum commission fee. This means that while luxury tenants face a clear 5 per cent commission, those renting more affordable units might feel the pinch more significantly,” she continued. Rupert Simmonds, leasing director at Betterhomes, said commission rates have remained the same, although, due to higher prices, the actual amount paid often increases. “As the commission is charged as a percentage of the contract value, luxury properties will often result in a higher overall fee. Some agencies will charge a minimum fixed commission amount for lower-value transactions, basically, where the cost of the work does not meet the value of the percentage charge,” he said. With the commission being charged as a percentage of the rent, he said the commission will be at a higher charge, based on the higher rental value of the property.",

      "description": "The Paris Agreement's ambitious goals depend on the active participation of the corporate world. But a pervasive culture of greenwashing – where eco-friendly promises often mask inaction or even deception – is eroding the trust essential for meaningful climate action",
      "content": "With COP29 scheduled for November this year, it is imperative to revisit the critical role of 196 parties in meeting the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C by the end of this century. While major emitting countries play a crucial role in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, it is equally important to seek the contributions of big businesses and large corporations to achieve this target. The increasing pressure to mitigate climate change and transition towards net-zero solutions is driving businesses to meet carbon neutrality targets. Zero-carbon solutions are becoming competitive across various economic sectors. The role of businesses and other organisations in averting the worst impacts of climate change requires greater attention. However, the growing prevalence of greenwashing could pose a significant challenge to these efforts. For consumers, going green is becoming increasingly important. Many young consumers, particularly Millennials and Gen Z-ers, are keen to buy from “ethical” companies and look for “sustainable” labels. Unilever estimates that almost 70 per cent of the company’s greenhouse gas footprint depends on the products consumers choose and whether they dispose of them in a sustainable manner. As consumers become more environmentally conscious, companies are also striving to reduce the carbon footprint of their products, systems, processes, and services across different stages—from research and development to disposal—as part of their environmental management efforts. Pressure from stakeholders, investors, and consumers is driving businesses to implement carbon offsetting programmes to mitigate their environmental impact, thereby demonstrating a commitment to sustainability. At least on the surface. For example, McDonald’s had pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, even though the company’s emissions in 2021 were higher than its 2015 baseline. Starbucks eliminated plastic straws from all its stores worldwide with the aim of reducing waste sent to landfills from its stores and manufacturing by 2023; however, the company is now under fire as the new CEO plans to commute to the office by private jet . These targets aimed at mitigating climate change not only demonstrate corporate commitment to sustainability but also offer financial benefits by meeting both consumer and investor demands. Studies have shown that consumers are more likely to purchase green products when they believe that the companies selling those products take green marketing seriously, are knowledgeable about green products, and share their values. Moreover, such moves can attract ESG-conscious investors, who are increasingly looking to invest in companies that prioritise environmental, social, and governance factors in their everyday practices. Today’s investing models are constantly evolving. Investors are not only considering financial returns but also the overall impact of a company’s operations. ” rel=”noopener” target=”_blank”>Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors are increasingly getting recognised as essential tools in combating climate change. Investors increasingly demand investment-grade information on climate change and ESG performance to understand the relationship between climate change and investment risk. This compels companies to disclose the potential impact of climate change on their operations and detail the risk management strategies they have implemented to address these challenges. With significant financial resources and innovation, the pressure on leading corporations is greatly intensified to portray themselves as sustainable in the market. To secure ESG credentials, businesses are provoked to resort to means that could be misleading to consumers and investors. The reality behind corporate environmentalism can be disappointing. TerraChoice reported that over 95 per cent of products examined in a study commit one or more of the “sins of greenwashing”, indicating that deceptive marketing practices and false information have long existed in commercial activity. Lately, false and misleading environmental claims have become more common; this practice is known as “greenwashing.” There are various definitions of greenwashing from different perspectives, but the term primarily refers to the marketing practice of making unsubstantiated claims about a product or service as ethical, sustainable, eco-friendly, carbon neutral, or organic. For example, a mining business might emphasise the decarbonising advantages of its solar power plant while downplaying the hazardous chemicals it emits. Greenwashing can be a practice of misleading consumers regarding the environmental practices of an organisation, known as firm-level greenwashing. For example, in response to concerns about growing plastic pollution, McDonald’s decided to switch to paper straws. The company labelled its paper straws as “eco-friendly”, even though they could not be recycled. In this case, the company is using ambiguous terms like “eco-friendly” or “green” without clear definitions or criteria. The Think Pink scandal in Sweden is another significant example of environmental harm due to corporate negligence. Think Pink, once a revered Swedish Waste Management company, was exposed for its illegal practice of dumping 200,000 tonnes of hazardous waste at 21 different locations across Sweden. This toxic dumping released high levels of arsenic, lead, dioxins, copper, zinc, petrol products, and carcinogenic chemicals known as PCBs into the air, water and soil. In this instance, the company collected waste with no intention or ability to recycle it in accordance with legislation. The second type of greenwashing occurs when a company misleads consumers regarding the environmental benefits of a product or service, known as product/service level greenwashing. In 2019, Volkswagen was called out for its “clean diesel” claim. Portraying itself as a leader in sustainability and environmental responsibility, the company claimed that its Diesel TDI engines significantly reduced emissions and met emissions standards. However, in 2014, a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) on modern diesel cars analysed the emissions produced by Volkswagen during normal driving conditions. The study highlighted that Volkswagen diesel cars emitted nitrogen oxide (NOx) at levels seven times higher than their emissions testing. This was because Volkswagen used software known as a “defeat device” to switch to low-emission mode when it detected an emission test situation. Following this, the company experienced a notable decline in sales. As consumer awareness about climate change increases, concerns around greenwashing are also rising. The impact of greenwashing is detrimental to our collective progress toward achieving global climate goals. As no government or organisation can meet the Paris Agreement goals alone, there is a need for collaboration between businesses, governments, and stakeholders. A report published by Baker McKenzie, titled The Race To Net-Zero , indicates that while there is a significant commitment among companies to achieve net zero by 2050, the actual progress may not be as substantial as their pledges suggest. Even though companies like Starbucks are making public commitments to sustainability, whether these commitments translate into meaningful actions is a bigger question.

      "description": "Several gunshot victims have lain dead or wounded and unattended for long stretches following ShotSpotter's contract expiration.",
      "content": "The anger is building as the tragedies are unfolding. It’s been just two weeks since Mayor Brandon Johnson decided in the face of overwhelming opposition within the City Council to end the city’s contract with the company that owns and operates the ShotSpotter gunshot-detection technology. In that brief period, we’ve seen cases of gunshot victims in areas previously served by ShotSpotter discovered by first responders only when they were dead. In those situations, no one called 911 to say they had heard shots fired. Two weeks. And there already have been six instances of what the invaluable crime reporting service, CWBChicago, is now calling “Brandon’s Bodies.” That’s a harsh but justifiable tagline. Johnson took this action, fulfilling a campaign promise he’d made, even as far more data than was available during the election surfaced showing how ShotSpotter saves lives. It does so by alerting first responders to gunshots immediately and — crucially — giving them accurate information on where those shots were fired. In so many documented cases that this effect now is impossible to refute, the technology saves precious time that can make the difference between life and death for victims who’ve initially survived gunshots but otherwise won’t survive without immediate care. On the East Side, mourners last week held a vigil for 19-year-old Sierra Evans, who was shot to death in a dark alley, apparently shortly after midnight on Saturday, Sept. 28, and whose body wasn’t discovered until someone called authorities nine hours later . ShotSpotter sensors detected the shots at 12:06 a.m., but the information wasn’t transmitted to police because Johnson had cut off the service, according to 17th Ward Ald. David Moore, who has led the City Council’s effort to overrule the mayor and preserve the technology. Making these incidents all the more terrible is that the ShotSpotter sensors still are up in the wards in which they’ve been operating for seven years. They’re still detecting gunshots. But now the information isn’t being relayed to Chicago police because there’s no contract. Chicago Tribune reporter Karina Atkins attended the vigil, and the agony of Evans’ family and friends was palpable in her reporting. There was anger as well. Tenth Ward Ald. Peter Chico, another ShotSpotter supporter, said of his slain constituent, “Her lying here in the alley for eight, nine hours is unacceptable. It’s inhumane. If ShotSpotter wasn’t released, it would have alerted the police to get here much more quickly.” Amen to that. Writing on Facebook of Sierra Evans’ death, the Rev. Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Church on the South Side who’s long toiled on the front lines of Chicago’s gun-violence epidemic, remarked, “How many more will there be?” How many more indeed? Two aldermen, Moore and Monique Scott, who represents the 24th Ward, including violence-ravaged North Lawndale, called on Johnson to reverse his stand and reinstate ShotSpotter “immediately.” A 14-year-old boy was gunned down last Tuesday night and died on a street in her ward, Scott wrote on Instagram; his body wasn’t discovered until an hour after he was shot. “An ambulance could have been dispatched within minutes, but instead a young man bled out on the street,” she wrote. How did she know the response took an hour? Because the ShotSpotter sensors in her ward still are there and detecting the shots. She reached out to SoundThinking, the company that owns the technology, and they confirmed for her when the shots rang out. As a side note, it’s interesting that SoundThinking hasn’t yet begun dismantling the sensors or stopped collecting data from them despite the expiration of its contract. It’s clear to us the company is keeping the system intact for now and is responding to its aldermanic supporters when they ask for information after a tragedy in hopes of putting pressure on the mayor to change his mind. Some may wonder at SoundThinking’s motivations, but in this case what’s in the interest of the company’s bottom line is aligned with the needs of Chicago and its residents, particularly those in neighborhoods most susceptible to gun violence. Even as Johnson went through on Sept. 22 with his promise to cut ties with ShotSpotter, his administration said it would begin a formal process to “gather recommendations on reliable and efficient forms of first responder technology to ensure immediate attention from first responders in emergency situations.” A mayor who was serious about the issue long ago would have started the process of finding a ShotSpotter replacement instead of waiting until the day he pulled the plug. Finding an equally effective replacement, if one even exists, likely will take months, if not longer. In the meantime, there already is a technology that “ensures immediate attention from first responders in emergency situations.” It’s called ShotSpotter. These two weeks alone have proved Johnson’s move to pull the ShotSpotter plug was both mulish and foolish. The mayor’s explanations for the unpopular decision have bordered on incoherent. But the real motivation appears to be that he promised during the 2023 mayoral campaign to get rid of ShotSpotter, and he felt bound to honor his promise. As Ald. Scott rightly said during the last City Council debate before ShotSpotter went away, “You can’t put a life over a campaign promise.” There was ample room for Johnson to pivot, given the compelling information we have now on ShotSpotter’s benefits that wasn’t available during the campaign. We don’t know for sure if Sierra Evans’ life could have been saved had help arrived in a timely fashion. Nor if any other of “Brandon’s bodies” would have still been living Chicagoans if ShotSpotter were still transmitting. But Evans’ body lay unattended for nine hours in an alley in the neighborhood she called home. That is enraging and the responsibility of Chicago’s mayor.

      "description": "Republicans say journalists shouldn't be pointing out their lies. But in the era of post-factual MAGA politics, most voters are grateful for the service.",
      "content": "Question : When did fact - checking become an outrageous abuse of debate moderator s ’ power? Answer: When MAGA Republicans decided they didn’t like anyone pointing out that they’re lying . In a perfect world, it might be enough for political opponents to correct each other’s prevarications and exaggerations. But Donald Trump’s entry into presidential politics, with his incessant flights of fancy and nonstop lying, have completely changed the dynamics. While other presidential candidates have stretched the truth, only one has kidnapped it, bound and gagged it, put it in a barrel and tossed it into the East River. In the age of Trump, fact-checking has become a necessary service for moderators and other journalists to provide to voters. Take the first and probably only presidential debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, on Sept. 10. Some Trumpers went bonkers after ABC News’ David Muir corrected one of the former president’s most egregious and dangerous falsehoods — that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting pets and eating them. Muir noted that Springfield’s city manager said there were no credible claims of pets being “harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.” “But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there,” Trump insisted in the course of a rant that launched a kajillion memes . There is not a single television interview of any Springfield pet owner claiming their cat or dog was stolen and eaten by immigrants. There was a news story about a woman killing and appearing to eat a cat, but she was born in and lived in Canton, about 175 miles away from Springfield. (She was reportedly charged with “disorderly conduct by reason of intoxication,” among other offenses.) In any case, Muir didn’t just have a journalistic obligation to call Trump on his race-baiting lie. He had a moral obligation to do so because that kind of incendiary claim can get people killed. Springfield has yet to recover from Trump’s collective character assassination. In the first and only vice presidential debate last week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance picked up where Trump left off, blaming “illegal” immigrants in places such as Springfield for overwhelming schools and hospitals and driving up the price of real estate. Moderator Margaret Brennan of CBS News correctly noted that the Haitian immigrants Vance was alluding to are, in fact, here legally. Most have what is called temporary protected status , a designation that the Biden administration has expanded. “Margaret,” Vance complained, “the rules were that you guys weren’t going to fact-check, and since you’re fact-checking me, I think it’s important to say what’s actually going on.” He went on for a moment, but what’s actually going on is far too complicated for a debate sound bite, and the moderators soon cut both candidates’ microphones, which was allowed by the rules. Trump supporters blew their lids. “F you CBS — how DARE YOU,” posted the conservative firebrand Megyn Kelly , who was axed by NBC News in 2018 for suggesting that there was nothing wrong with white people wearing blackface for Halloween. Kelly, who herself famously tangled with Trump as a debate moderator for Fox News, also once insisted that Santa Claus cannot possibly be Black because he “just is white.” The F-word, by the way, is apparently Kelly’s go-to response in defense of Trump. After the world’s most popular singer endorsed Harris, Kelly responded, “F you, Taylor Swift.” Elegant! I can’t wait to hear what she says about Bruce Springsteen’s recent Harris endorsement. “‘Fact check’ has become just another word for censorship,” was the headline on a recent New York Post column by Douglas Murray, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute. This makes no sense. Censorship implies suppression of speech before it is aired. In a broadcast debate, a candidate actually has to spout the lie before moderators can correct it. Murray condemned Muir and fellow moderator Linsey Davis for failing to contradict Harris when she claimed that Project 2025 is “a detailed and dangerous plan ... that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again.” “They must have known that the big Democratic boogey man ‘Project 2025’ has nothing to do with Donald Trump or his campaign,” Murray wrote, presumably with a straight face. This is such bald-faced lie that I would be remiss if I did not fact-check Murray myself. Project 2025 is a 900-page blueprint for a second Trump administration by the right-wing Heritage Foundation. At least 140 former members of Trump’s first administration are involved, CNN has reported, including six former Cabinet secretaries. It calls for, among other things, abolishing the Department of Education and Head Start, ending efforts to combat climate change, undermining the independence of the Justice Department, effectively enacting a nationwide abortion ban, and dismantling what MAGA Republicans call “the deep state,” known to those in the reality-based community as “government.” A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Brookings Institution said that parts of Project 2025 “are more closely aligned with a white Christian nationalist worldview than a traditional, conservative education policy agenda.” Once Project 2025’s radical plan to overhaul the executive branch became widely known and the public reacted negatively , Trump pretended as if he’d never heard of it. And the conservative, Trump-promoting New York Post would very much like you to believe that untruth. As it happens, most Americans think debate moderators should fact-check. According to a June survey by Boston University’s College of Communication (my graduate school alma mater), more than two of every three Americans surveyed said “moderators should point out factual inaccuracies” in candidates’ statements during debates. The survey did find a partisan discrepancy: While 81% of Democrats supported fact-checking in real time, 67% of Republicans did. Gee, why do you suppose that is? @robinkabcarian",

      "description": "If climate change continues to spiral out of control, we risk leaving people a world of irreparable environmental and economic destruction.",
      "content": "Chicagoland is more than just a place to live — it’s a vibrant region that blends the energy of city life with the charm of suburban living. From the serene paths of the Morton Arboretum to iconic landmarks such as Millennium Park, it offers a perfect mix of urban excitement and suburban tranquility. Sadly, we are facing significant threats. Rising temperatures, heavier rainfall and fluctuating Lake Michigan water levels disrupt outdoor activities, erode shorelines and damage infrastructure, making the effects of climate change impossible to ignore. Political campaigns often center the economy as a major issue swaying voters, but in today’s political arena, the climate crisis deserves equal attention. With the presidential election approaching, voters must recognize that climate change isn’t just an environmental issue; it’s also a pressing economic threat. Financial impacts rapidly escalate as extreme weather events grow more frequent and costly. Flooding and heat waves in Illinois devastate local businesses, agriculture and tourism. Last year, the U.S. endured a record number of billion-dollar weather events, with disasters occurring every two weeks on average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Consequently, insurance companies are raising premiums and withdrawing coverage in some areas, jeopardizing housing affordability. Despite these clear signs, climate change remains a sidelined issue in political discourse. As Nov. 5 nears, Illinois voters must urge elected officials to acknowledge the direct connection between climate solutions and economic stability. Failing to address this causes only greater ecological and financial crises for future generations. A recent study conducted by the global consulting firm ICF predicts that today’s children will face a financial burden of up to $1 million each, stemming from rising living costs and reduced earnings linked to climate inaction. These costs will compound the longer we delay action, straining household budgets as food prices rise and extreme weather devastates farmland. People across the political spectrum care deeply about the future of their loved ones. If climate change continues to spiral out of control, we risk leaving them a world of irreparable environmental and economic destruction. We must advocate for a Chicagoland where our children and grandchildren can flourish, free from the dangers of climate change. This election serves as a crucial reminder to demand action and hold leaders accountable for prioritizing climate solutions — not only for the planet’s survival but also for a prosperous economic future. — Ava Cohen, Elmhurst Coastal North Carolinians may have long been aware of the danger from storms fueled by climate change, but those living in the mountain city of Asheville may not have been expecting what they got from a hurricane that made landfall more than 500 miles away. Helene’s unprecedented destruction came from what scientists call “rapid intensification,” resulting from Gulf of Mexico waters hotter than they’ve ever been. Hot water is the fuel that pumps energy into hurricanes, turning them into monsters like Helene. We’ve known for more than 40 years that excess heat buildup in the atmosphere is caused by increased carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. Much of that excess heat ends up in the oceans, and the result is depressingly predictable: tropical cyclones that can exceed anything our infrastructure was built to withstand. Our hearts are breaking to see the suffering of the victims. But what about the cost? Some may complain that it is hard-hearted to discuss money when people’s lives have been destroyed. Others may object to raising a “political issue” like global warming while entire communities have been wiped out. Meanwhile, political reporters tell us that voters’ top priority in election season is the economy, with climate change residing far down the list. That should tell us something about how the public fails to make the connection between climate and the economy. Climate change is draining our collective pocketbooks with soaring insurance losses in states hit by storms, floods and wildfires. It’s destroying our infrastructure, which must be rebuilt from tax dollars or government borrowing. It’s raising our health care costs due to pollution and the trauma suffered by victims of these unnatural disasters. The global impact of climate change even affects migration, with desperate people leaving their homelands because they can no longer grow the crops they need to survive. Climate change cannot be dismissed as a “political issue,” no matter how persistently some politicians try to make it one. It’s a harsh reality that we need to face without equivocation and shrugs. We can stop it in its tracks if we can persuade our political leaders that we truly care about it. But it’s also incumbent on our news media to help the public understand the truth, not contribute to their uncertainty and confusion. — Rick Knight, Brookfield We need to review our rivers and flood plan. Climate change is real. There has to be a master plan of river dredging and levee system where flood waters could be diverted from cities, crucial bridges and infrastructure. — Ray and Alena Gust, Deer Park DuPage County is blessed with a rich tapestry of forest preserves that encompass more than 25,000 acres. These public lands enrich our quality of life and provide outdoor recreation areas for citizens to relax, unplug, and enjoy the mental and physical health benefits of nature. On Nov. 5, voters will be asked to support forest preserves in DuPage County. The Forest Preserve District is asking for a small levy increase to preserve more land, maintain and restore existing forest preserves, add recreational amenities such as trails and improve public access. Since the pandemic, attendance at many forest preserves has nearly doubled as people continue to discover the many benefits forest preserves provide to our lives and our communities. With approval from the voters, the Forest Preserve District would be better able to improve air and water quality, purchase land, restore and create more wildlife habitat, improve flood control, expand public safety, and create more places where children can enjoy the wonders of nature. With land prices skyrocketing and the amount of natural land dwindling, we must act now to preserve our last remaining open spaces for our children and our grandchildren before they are lost to development. The cost for the average homeowner in DuPage County would be approximately $3 to $4 per month. The Forest Preserve District is less than 2% of our taxes. If this referendum passes, the amount would still be less than 2%. That’s a small price to pay to keep our forest preserves green and healthy and our air and water clean for present and future generations. The Conservation Foundation asks that voters support our DuPage Forest preserves on Nov. 5 with a “yes” vote. — Brook McDonald, president and CEO, The Conservation Foundation, Naperville Submit a letter, of no more than 400 words, to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com .",

      "description": "You don't have to be a fact checker to know that Donald Trump and JD Vance are telling whoppers about the Republican record on health care reform.",
      "content": "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, it is said. And in Washington, so is stealing credit. Is there a better example than Republican lawmakers praising themselves for “saving” the federal health care law that they fought long and hard to defeat, repeal and otherwise sabotage? Now we can count both former President Donald Trump and his GOP running mate and ideological “Mini-Me,” Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, in that number. You don’t have to be a TV network fact-checker to know that Trump and Vance are telling whoppers about the Republican record on health care reform. You need only to have been mildly sentient during Trump’s presidency. For example, during the vice presidential debate with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vance proudly claimed that Trump “salvaged” the Affordable Care Act, informally known as “Obamacare,” and tried to improve it during his time in office. “When Obamacare was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden and health care costs, Donald Trump could have destroyed the program,” Vance said . ”Instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care.” Oh, please. Whatever the Trump administration may have done to “save” the ACA came after repeated attempts to kill it. On his very first day as president, Trump eagerly signed an executive order to repeal the government-funded Obamacare. That made for a suitable photo-op but had little impact in real life on the complicated behemoth of government health care. More legislative proposals to “repeal and replace” the law followed. They included measures to restructure Medicaid, weaken protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions and shift funding of private insurance away from the poorest and sickest toward those who were healthier and wealthier. Many of us who care about this important issue recall how vigorously Trump worked his signature pen to weaken Obamacare marketplaces, cut spending for advertising and enrollment assistance, and channel funds to different priorities — such as funding videos and social media messaging criticizing the ACA — to please conservatives. “We’ll let Obamacare fail,” Trump said in July 2017, when the repeal bills were struggling. “And then the Democrats are going to come to us.” As it happened, despite widespread public skepticism about the ACA, inspired in no small part by the vigorous efforts of Republicans to trash it, once the law was enacted, millions of uninsured Americans gained access to real health care, and the program’s popularity grew. Republicans now recognize it for the third rail that it is on Capitol Hill: Touch it, and you die. So we have Trump to thank for the success of Obamacare? I can only imagine the mental gymnastics that it took for Vance, a highly intelligent and educated person, to convince himself of that proposition, or at least to pretend he believed it. Mark it down to chutzpah, if you like, but there was a different lie, a much more serious lie, that Vance could not bring himself to enunciate. For most of the night, the more polished and media-savvy Vance seemed to be winning the debate, in my view. But when Walz challenged him to say who won the 2020 election, Vance’s discomfort with his running mate’s growing web of half-truths, fabrications and outright lies seemed to show itself. As simple as the question “Who won the 2020 election?” might be to answer in most galaxies, in MAGA world, it is the defining issue, the shibboleth that separates the true Trump believers from the perfidious RINOs — Republicans in name only. Vance, a rising star in that world, refused to give a direct answer. He ducked, dodged, obfuscated and tried to change the subject. He tried to do a little sidestep, saying he preferred to stay “focused on the future,” an old dodge by politicians who find themselves to be thoroughly uncomfortable with the present. Reeled back toward the question at hand, he tried another dodge. He wanted to answer a question he asked himself about whether Kamala Harris censored Americans from speaking their minds in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. No dice. Walz then cut in with one of his most aggressive attack lines of the evening: “That is a damning nonanswer.” Indeed, having dug himself into a hole, Vance figuratively pulled dirt in on top of himself: He declined to rule out challenging the outcome of the 2024 race, a mission Trump tried unsuccessfully to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to complete.

      "description": "Canada has not taken the threat of Islamic terrorism seriously enough",
      "content": "On the first anniversary of the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel, it’s worth looking back at the lessons we learned, or should have learned, over the past year. First, it’s always appropriate to remember what happened a year ago. In a surprise attack, Hamas terrorists stormed across the Gaza-Israel border, torturing, raping and killing over 1,200 Israeli citizens and foreign nationals. Hamas also took 251 hostages — some have returned, some have been killed and many remain captive. Taking a broader regional perspective is also helpful. From Israel’s establishment in 1948 to the Yom Kippur War in 1973, each decade saw Israel face down hostile Arab states. Eventually, many of the Arab countries accepted Israel’s existence. With the signing of the Abraham Accords in 2020, many of those same countries agreed to work with Israel, both militarily and economically. At the same time, Israel made numerous attempts to achieve peace with the Palestinians, who repeatedly rejected such overtures. With the imposition of the radical Islamic regime in Iran in 1979, tensions between Israel and the Palestinians were turned into an opportunity for Iran to work through its proxies — Hamas, Hezbollah and others — to destabilize the Middle East generally, and prevent peace between Israel and the Palestinians specifically. In short, this is a regional conflict that’s been inflamed by Iran’s exploitative radicalization of local populations, including the Palestinians. This context is helpful when we consider some of the responses to October 7 in Canada. Among the more disturbing reactions that followed the attack were pro-Palestinian protests in major cities coupled with the establishment of encampments on several Canadian university campuses. Many of the protests took place outside Jewish community centres or near neighbourhoods with large Jewish populations. This was the case with the January protests on an overpass in Toronto , as well as anti-Israel protests in front of a synagogue in Thornhill , Ont., in March. Pro-Palestinian university encampments engaged in even more aggressive tactics, staking out and commandeering sites on campuses from Halifax to Victoria. Students and non-students alike, often supported by a coterie of academic staff, demanded that their respective institutions divest from all companies with ties to Israel and its defence efforts. Eventually, university administrators acted to remove the encampments, either by police intervention or legal injunctions using trespass laws, despite the misleading objections of a gaggle of law professors . Encampment protesters, along with those on the streets, habitually chanted the slogan, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” This antisemitic invective clearly implies the elimination of Israel. Its justification derives from the notion that Jewish Israelis are somehow “settlers” on the land, and the Palestinians Arabs, by contrast, are the indigenous population. This claim is made even though the Jews have an ancestral claim to the region stretching back centuries before the arrival of the Arab population, with archeological evidence dating to at least to the time of the First Temple and the Assyrian (722 BC) and Babylonian (597 BC) invasions. When confronted with the charge that their chants are antisemitic, protesters adamantly argue that opposing Zionism — and even the very existence of the Israeli state, the only democracy in the region — does not constitute antisemitism. Again, they turn to the justification that Israel and Israeli Jews form an illegitimate “settler society.” By making these claims, the protesters narrow and diminish the concept of antisemitism, to the point that virtually any hostile action against Jews is now seen as legitimate. Even the ultimate antisemitic act of the Holocaust is thrown back at Israel, with claims that its defensive actions against Hamas constitute a “genocide.” The old lesson we need to remember here is that this is exactly what antisemitism is. Since the time of the medieval blood libel, Jews have been repeatedly dehumanized by those who diminish their humanity while expanding the scope of their imaginary treachery. Today in Canada, as elsewhere in the West, the return of antisemitism is justified by the ideology popularly called “wokeism,” though it is better labelled as “progressive illiberalism.” This doctrine was born in our universities from a mixture of postmodernism, post-colonialism, critical theory and neofeminism. Over the last decade, it has made immense gains throughout our society. It now expresses itself explicitly through theories of anti-racism, gender ideology and in the settler-colonial narrative that’s used to attack Israel. Ultimately, it should not surprise us that this same ideology was at the intellectual heart of the Islamic Revolution that took Iran from a relatively free secular society to an oppressive Islamist dictatorship in 1979. And now, in Canada, in addition to promoting antisemitism, it has contributed to the weakening of our immigration system, which has allowed terrorist operatives to use Canada as a staging ground . As for Islamist ideology, Canada permits groups like Samidoun, which is banned in Germany, to actively support pro-Hamas rallies across the country. The alliance between progressive illiberalism, settler-colonial ideology and the Islamism promoted by the Iranian regime is undermining Canadian politics and society, while threatening our Jewish and Muslim communities. While Israel and many of the Arab states understand the true nature of the threat to their countries, Canadians have a few lessons yet to learn on this solemn anniversary.

      "description": "In the final days of this tumultuous 2024 campaign season, centrism doesn’t look so squishy after all.",
      "content": "Political centrism has a bad name. In fact, it has a lot of bad names. Centrists have been denigrated as squishy, weak in the knees, guilty of being sellouts — and worse, unpatriotic. However, the idea of centrism has been getting a second look recently. Americans are feeling like they are imprisoned for life in the politics of extremism and rage, and they’ve become more desperate to break out. Voters are just exhausted, according to many surveys. Americans have tried Democratic control of the government. They’ve tried Republican control. They’ve also tried divided government. Very soon, they will toy with either “democratic socialism” under Kamala Harris or anarchical libertarianism and untethered randomness under Donald Trump. Especially in the final days of this tumultuous 2024 campaign season, centrism doesn’t look so squishy after all, does it? Politically, it has gone from being considered a sedative to a stimulant. Centrist themes are popping up in conversation; institutional organizations are adopting it as a cause. Political leaders are holding seminars and conferences on the subject. Commentators and pundits are giving it ink and airtime. Cases in point: A recent article in The Atlantic by Yuval Levin, “ What’s Wrong with Congress (And How to Fix It) ,” advocates for “cross-partisan coalition building,” among other centrist-leaning congressional reforms. South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson wrote recently, “We need thoughtful discourse among engaged citizens, not emotional attacks from enraged partisans,” in introducing his “six paths to civility.” Current and former senators and members of Congress have created the movement Our Republican Legacy to restore the party to its founding principles, which were more traditionally conservative and centrist in their direction. But what is centrism? Is it an ideology, a composite of ideas and beliefs that comprise a political philosophy? Or is it a methodology, simply a form of decision-making in a polarized environment? Centrism gets its energy and appeal from civil discourse, a knowledgeable citizenry and a distinct set of political values. It is also a pattern of decision-making that puts greater emphasis on pragmatism, bipartisanship, incrementalism, reason and tolerance for divergent beliefs. It is a lot more than splitting the difference between two contrasting pieces of legislation. Centrism is often an entirely fresh approach to a problem. It is founded on reasoned judgment rather than emotional belligerence. It is an antidote for extremism and a path toward making politics and government work again. It is not a third party, but it could provide the framework for one. You don’t have to sacrifice your principles to engage in centrist governance. All of that doesn’t mean centrism is a panacea. Far from it. In politics as in much of life, panaceas don’t exist. There are no cure-alls in an imperfect system created and run by imperfect human beings. But centrism may be a way out of the political and social mess we’ve gotten ourselves into. Consider illegal immigration. The issue was, due to neglect, a problem that turned into a partisan, political, humanitarian, economic, constitutional and international crisis. There was no need for that. Now it has become a catastrophe to resolve. Workable solutions have been on the table over the decades, but because of polarized politics, only a rare few have been enacted. There are dozens of other issues that suffer the same fate as immigration, among them Social Security and Medicare, the need to upgrade the energy grid and the rising tide of public debt. They, too, have become so complex that no resolution seems possible. Those at the extremes have argued that a centrist approach is just settling for half a loaf, but in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan and House Leader Bob Michel, for whom I served as chief of staff, were fond of reminding us that the alternative was no loaf at all, which is what we are left with more often today. They and other reasoned and reasonable leaders, most notably one-time Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker Jr., understood the machinations of a divided Congress and engaged in the kind of coalition building that gave America a working government. It seems House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries have shopped at the same bakery. On several occasions, they have been able to create an atmosphere in which bipartisan cooperation, pragmatic negotiations and sensible solutions are possible. So have others at the committee and subcommittee levels. Good leaders know that serving the public interest first also means recognizing that the fears, anxieties and the sense of abandonment that have exhausted millions of Americans are legitimate sensibilities that need assuaging. They just want the work of government to get done and their lives made better, which is the focus of “Fixing Congress: Restoring Power to the People,” a book I co-authored with Jerome F. Climer. Centrism is a solution. An ample number of current and future political leaders could assume the mantle of centrist leadership. It is up to Americans, the media and political institutions to draw them out, encourage that concept and give them platforms for advancing a new way to conduct the nation’s business. And when? Hopefully, within my lifetime. I and so many others are getting too old for this. Michael S. Johnson spent 47 years serving in the White House, Congress, private sector media relations and advocacy, as well as a number of nonprofit organizations dedicated to improving the work of the legislative and executive branches.

      "description": "Former President Trump's denial of the 2020 election results swung back into focus in the 2024 presidential race after it was raised as an issue by Gov. Tim Walz at the vice presidential debate and by Special Counsel Jack Smith in a new federal court filing.",
      "content": "In the waning minutes of Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate , Gov. Tim Walz hit on a question that has become central to the 2024 presidential race — and to America’s political future more broadly. Walz, who is Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, was sparring with Sen. JD Vance, former President Trump’s running mate, over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters intent on overturning the 2020 election of President Biden. Walz called the attack “a threat to our democracy,” and one driven by Trump’s refusal to admit defeat. “He is still saying he didn’t lose the election,” Walz said to Vance. “I would just ask that: Did he lose the 2020 election?” Vance, unwilling to buck Trump’s false claim that the last election was stolen, said he was “focused on the future.” “That,” Walz said, “is a damning non-answer.” The next day, the issue was again magnified for voters when a federal judge in Washington released a new court filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith, in which Smith provided the most comprehensive accounting to date of what prosecutors allege was a sweeping criminal conspiracy by Trump and his allies to not just deny the election, but also subvert it. “When [Trump] lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,” Smith wrote. Taken together, the two episodes served as a stark reminder of something Democrats have been eager for voters to focus on in the current race: the former president’s alleged willingness to undermine the will of voters in the last one. State elections officials, independent elections experts and most Americans agree today that Biden’s victory over Trump was legitimate. Despite substantial efforts to do so by Trump’s backers, no one has produced evidence of substantial voter fraud or election irregularities, and experts have concluded there were none. Democrats have condemned Trump for his dishonesty and impeached him in the House for inciting the Jan. 6 attack, and Smith and prosecutors in Georgia have indicted Trump for his alleged scheme to remain in power illegitimately. Trump, meanwhile, has maintained his position that the election was stolen from him, and many Republicans still believe the same. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll in December, for example, found that 62% of U.S. adults said they believe Biden was legitimately elected. While 91% of Democrats believe it, just 31% of Republicans do, the survey found. Trump has downplayed the Jan. 6 attack and promised to pardon those convicted in the fray. He also has begun already to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the upcoming election. As voters begin casting their ballots in the current race, political experts say they will be weighing a host of issues, including the economy, immigration and reproductive rights. But particularly after the last week, they also may be thinking about Trump’s election denial and the fallout from it, the experts said — and for good reason. “It’s not just about denying 2020,” said Bob Shrum, director of the Center for the Political Future at USC. “It’s about whether or not you are going to uphold the fundamental precepts of democracy.” “It should be a major issue for voters,” said Richard L. Hasen, director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA Law, “because, really, it was an unprecedented attempt to steal an election.” More than just denial After Smith’s lastest filing was released, Trump went into a rage on his social media platform Truth Social, accusing the Justice Department of “COMPLETE AND TOTAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE” and saying he did “NOTHING WRONG.” Trump called Smith’s case against him a “SCAM,” and suggested that the timing of the filing so close to the election broke with Justice Department rules for avoiding unnecessary political influence. The timing is in part due to Trump’s own efforts to fight the case. It was on an earlier trajectory before Trump appealed to the Supreme Court — which found in an unprecedented ruling in July that presidents enjoy broad immunity for actions taken as part of their official duties. Smith’s latest filing is a response to that ruling and a detailed articulation of why Trump’s actions to subvert the 2020 election were taken not in his official capacity as president, but in his private capacity as a losing political candidate — and therefore not something for which he enjoys immunity. The filing details how Trump allegedly “laid the groundwork for his crimes” well before the election even occurred, including by telling advisors that he would claim victory before ballots were even counted, and how he continued to push his election fraud narrative long after he was told, repeatedly, that no such fraud existed. Smith wrote that Trump conducted a “pressure campaign” targeting Republican leaders, election officials and election workers in states he had lost in an effort to change the outcomes there — such as when he told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that he wanted to “find 11,780 votes,” a margin that would have won him that state. When those efforts failed, Smith wrote, Trump personally set into motion and monitored a brazen plan to send fake slates of electors to Washington to cast state electoral votes for him instead of Biden, who had won them. He continued his “stream of disinformation” on Jan. 6, Smith wrote, falsely suggesting Pence could unilaterally halt the certification of Biden’s victory and motivating his supporters to storm the Capitol. Hasen said all Americans should read the filing to get a “good picture of the depths to which Trump was willing to go to try to turn himself from an election loser to an election winner.” Most important, Hasen said, is the number of times it shows Trump ignored evidence that he lost. “Just in terms of the morality of it, to know that the election was not stolen and to keep claiming it and undermining American democracy is incredibly dangerous and deserving of condemnation,” Hasen said. Why it matters Trump claims that a vast majority of Americans feel the 2020 election was rigged. It was not, and they do not, according to polling. However, a sizable minority do feel that way, and many leading Republicans have done little to dispel the notion. During the debate, for example, Vance downplayed the historic threat of the Jan. 6 attack and suggested that Trump had adhered to democratic standards by ceding power to Biden at his Jan. 20, 2021, inauguration. “It’s really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country,” Vance said. In fact, Trump refused to attend Biden’s inauguration, making him the first president in 150 years to skip one. Walz accused Vance of advancing “revisionist history,” and the next day told reporters that it should be “disqualifying” for Vance to not acknowledge Biden’s victory. Experts said such election denial is indeed a serious issue, and a dangerous thing for Trump and Vance to advance. Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said her organization is involved in dozens of legal actions across the country in advance of next month’s election, from groups that she said are “setting the stage for this narrative that there is something nefarious at play, that there is something questionable, that the results of the election aren’t valid.” The litigation is clearly part of a broader strategy, largely on the political right and clearly borne out of what happened in 2020, to “launder” legitimacy for later election denial claims through the legal system, Lakin said. Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the Voting Rights Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, agreed. “The effort to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election and everything that followed did kind of spawn a whole election denier movement that has proliferated and has been funded and has been pushed forward by not just Trump but a number of other prominent figures, and it has led to a situation in 2024 where there is a much broader, more coordinated effort to undermine faith in our elections, to sow distrust, and to set the stage to subvert the outcome of elections in 2024,” Morales-Doyle said. That said, both he and Lakin said there is room for hope. Among other things, prominent election deniers who ran for election offices in swing states in 2022 were resoundingly defeated , they noted. And some states have passed new laws since 2020 to shore up election systems and make frivolous challenges to election results more difficult. Morales-Doyle said he wants people to be aware of election denial and the threats it poses, but also to not get discouraged by it — because the evidence shows American election systems are strong, and thinking otherwise based on misinformation only serves to weaken them. “The best way to respond to these unprecedented attacks is to buy into democracy, to participate, to go and vote,” he said. Shrum said Vance was clearly “talking to an audience of one, Donald Trump,” when he wouldn’t answer Walz‘s question about the 2020 election, but that his doing so didn’t do Trump any favors. “Trump has convinced a substantial part of his base, of the people who are voting for him, that there was something wrong with the election, but I don’t think Americans generally think that,” Shrum said. “In fact, it drives voters away.” Polling shows that many Americans take a dim view of election denial. One recent Monmouth University poll , for example, found that 58% of Americans believed that an unwillingness to accept election outcomes was a “major problem” for the country. Republican elections officials are among those expressing concerns. Late last year, the Johns Hopkins SNF Agora Institute and Gallup released polling that showed that only 40% of Republicans were very or somewhat confident in the accuracy of U.S. elections. Along with the polling, a group from Johns Hopkins and the conservative-leaning think tank R Street Institute released a set of “core principles” for restoring that trust — including having conservative leaders publicly affirm election system security and champion policy changes that build trust. “As Republican state election officials, we believe in the power of citizens to choose their leaders freely and fairly, and we have faith in the integrity of election systems in place to carry out the voters’ will,” said the group’s members — including Raffensperger of Georgia, Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson. “We are also worried. Our democracy cannot hold if its citizens do not trust that elections accurately reflect the will of the people.” Charles H. Stewart, a political science professor and director of the MIT Election Data + Science Lab, said many Americans already understand — at least in broad strokes — that Trump denied the election and worked to reverse the results. Stewart doesn’t expect Smith’s latest filing or Walz’s debate efforts to swing voters in any major way, but said they “may keep the issue more visible” and increase the “enthusiasm” for voting among those most appalled by Trump’s actions. Hasen said he hopes more Americans work to understand the full implications of Trump’s election denial, and vote accordingly. “The question of whether we will have peaceful transitions of power,” Hasen said, “should be one of the top things on every voter’s list of considerations.”",

      "description": "The Trump-Harris race will come down to the seven states that decided the last presidential race. The fight for control of the House and Senate also looks to be close.",
      "content": "Today we discuss cliff-hangers, the Founding Fathers and legerdemain. Let’s get to it. Who’s going to win the presidential race? I haven’t a clue. So what good are you? That’s a question readers ask all the time. What can you say about the race? The contest will come down to seven or so highly competitive states and, maybe, the one electoral vote in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, which is anchored in the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area. The key states are Arizona , Georgia , Michigan, Nevada , North Carolina , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In short, the battlegrounds that determined the outcome of the 2020 election . Why the same states over and over? Why not, say, California? Pull up your chair for a quick civics refresher . The presidential race is determined not by the winner of the popular vote but which candidate takes a majority — 270 votes — in the electoral college . Some might recollect that two of our last four presidents — George W. Bush and Donald Trump — claimed the White House despite losing the popular vote. That’s outrageous! Can’t help you there. Blame the country’s founders. They wrote the rule book. Go on. Most states, including the biggies like California, Texas, Florida and New York, are locked into their partisan preferences. (California and New York are solidly Democratic while Texas and Florida — once the nation’s premier swing state — lean Republican.) Given those inclinations, Kamala Harris can pretty much bank on 226 electoral votes. Trump can count on 219. That leaves 93 up for grabs in those seven states. What was that about Omaha? Just about every state awards their electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. Nebraska is one of two — Maine being the other — that has a hybrid system awarding some electoral votes to the winner of the statewide vote and others based on the winner of each congressional district. There’s a not-inconceivable scenario in which Harris finishes with 269 electoral votes and needs the one vote from Nebraska to avoid a tie in the electoral college, which would send the election to the House to decide. In that case, Trump would almost certainly prevail, as each state’s delegation would have one vote and Republicans are expected to control more delegations than Democrats. Wasn’t there a recent effort to boost Trump by changing the law in Nebraska? Yes there was and it failed, thanks to a single upstanding Republican state senator from Omaha, Mike McDonnell, who refused to go along. Which was a good thing. Why is that? If you thought 2020 was fraught — with all the wrangling over pandemic-induced changes to the balloting process — or consider the 2000 contest to have been divisive — with a partisan Supreme Court vote delivering the White House to George W. Bush after Florida effectively ended in a tie vote — imagine if this election was decided by some last-minute Republican sleight of hand. What about control of Congress? That also appears up for grabs, though Republicans have a distinct advantage in the fight for the Senate. Because of that French word you used? Legerdemain? No. Because of mathematics. There are 34 Senate races across the country. Democrats are defending 23 seats, Republicans 11. Worse for Democrats, several of the seats they’re trying to hang onto are in states Trump carried in 2020 — several of them rather handily. Right now, Democrats hold a bare Senate 51-49 majority, which includes four independents who caucus with them. The party has ceded West Virginia, where one of those independents, Joe Manchin III, is retiring and where Trump won by nearly 40 percentage points in 2020. That puts the Senate at 50-50. Democrats could keep control if they win the White House, since the vice president casts the tie-breaking vote. But that would require the party to win every one of the seats now being fiercely contested. And how’s that going for Democrats? Not bad — but maybe not good enough. At the moment, Democrats appear to be holding their own in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. But Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin look to be much closer. And Democrat Jon Tester appears to be in grave danger in Montana, a state Trump carried four years ago by 16 percentage points. Tester has a history of winning tough races , but this one is his toughest yet. So it’s all gravy for Republicans? Pretty much. Democrats would love to flip GOP-held seats in Texas and Florida and help take out Sen. Deb Fischer in Nebraska, where independent Dan Osborn is making a strong run. But all three states are virtually certain to back Trump in November and it’s getting increasingly difficult for Senate candidates to swim against the partisan tide. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of U.S. senators began a century earlier, every Senate race went the same way as the presidential contest; if Trump won a state, the seat went Republican. If Hillary Clinton prevailed, the seat went Democratic. That pattern held in 2020 with the exception of Maine, where Joe Biden prevailed and Republican Susan Collins was reelected to her fifth term. What about control of the House? That’s also too close to call. Republicans currently hold a razor-wafer-tissue-thin (your choice!) majority of just four seats. All 435 seats are on November’s ballot, but the fight for the majority will come down to roughly two dozen contests. Several of those are in California, which has become one of the country’s prime congressional battlegrounds after voters in 2008 took the power to draw district lines away from self-interested lawmakers. Democrats hope to flip Republican-held seats in Orange County , the Central Valley , the L.A. suburbs and Palm Springs . They’re also on the offense in New York, where the GOP made significant gains in the 2022 midterm election. But Republicans aren’t just hunkered down trying to preserve their bare majority. GOP targets include a handful of Democratic-held seats in California as well as incumbents in Colorado, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. What do the poll s say? Ignore ‘em. Even the best are nothing more than an educated guess. No one knows what’s going to happen. Honest. Instead of obsessing over the latest higgledy-piggledy, do something useful. If you’re undecided, do some research. If you’re committed to a candidate, and have the time and inclination, volunteer to knock on doors or make phone calls. Above all, be sure to vote and do so in time to make certain your ballot is counted.",

      "description": "A history of short wars and long consequences",
      "content": "The history of the modern state of Israel is one of short wars with long consequences. For the first fifty years or so, until the millennium, that worked out largely to Israel’s benefit. In the year since the brutal attacks — replete with cold-blooded murder, rape and hostage-taking — by Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to wring long consequences from the wars against Hamas, Hezbollah and possibly Iran. This column argued last month that the strategic priority for Israel should be the expansion of the Abraham Accords; the creation of a new Middle East in which Israel and its Arab neighbours, including Saudi Arabia, would be able to contain Iran and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, and find some sort of workable governance solution for Gaza and the West Bank. It was the vision that Netanyahu presented at the United Nations just weeks before the Hamas attacks. The Israeli government, in the recent attacks on Hezbollah, has taken a different approach. Netanyahu’s government is seeking to contain Iran and its proxies on its own by force. If that is successful, it is reasonable to expect that Iran’s Arab neighbours would be grateful for Israel degrading the Iranian threat. That thinking appeals to Israel’s history of short wars with long consequences. Israel was attacked at its birth by its Arab neighbours. Israel prevailed in that initial war, 1947-48, and enlarged its frontiers. The initial UN plan for Israel put the new state in precarious borders. The war resulted in a larger Israel, more defensible. The Arab powers would have been better off if they had agreed to the original UN plan, as Israel had done. Then came the Suez crisis of 1956. Israel took the Sinai Peninsula, but was forced to withdraw by the Americans. Nevertheless, the war resulted in the opening of the Straits of Tiran between Sinai and Saudi Arabia, a critical strategic gain for Israel. The Six-Day War in 1967 was a triumph of biblical proportions for Israel, vanquishing Egypt, Syria and Jordan, and taking Sinai, Gaza, West Bank, Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, including the Old City. Israel had never controlled more territory, or been more secure. Too powerful perhaps, as the triumph of 1967 led a significant number of Israelis to dream of a greater Israel. Perpetual rule over Palestinians would be the price of that. In 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked on Yom Kippur and came close to victory in the initial days of surprise and shock. (The Hamas attacks last year were timed to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.) Israel rallied and repelled the Egyptians. The aftermath of the war marked an earthquake in Israel. Prime Minister Golda Meir was gone in 1974, and the long-ruling Labour Party was defeated in 1977. In 1979, then Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, the same who launched the attack on Yom Kippur, made peace with Israel, a peace that has endured forty-five years. Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to eject the Palestine Liberation Organization of Yasser Arafat. Israel got the PLO out, but ended up staying itself, a long and costly fight that did not end until 2000. The northern border was secure. The Gulf War of 1991 to eject Saddam Hussein from Kuwait did not engage Israeli forces, but it changed the regional dynamics. The PLO had backed Saddam, angering the Saudis and the Gulf states, and when he was defeated, the Palestinians were in a weak position. The 1993 Oslo Accords followed. The PLO would recognize Israel and accept partial sovereignty in the West Bank and Gaza. An Israeli-Jordan peace treaty would follow in 1994. The short-war-long-consequence pattern delivered an Israel at peace with its neighbours, secure in expanded borders and with an apparently feasible solution to the Palestinian question. What followed after 2000 was a never-ending series of wars without lasting consequences: the second intifada (2000-2005), the second Lebanon war (2006), four wars in Gaza after the Hamas takeover (2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021). Iran created an ongoing threat to Israel on its borders. Conflict in Gaza and Lebanon was persistent, and the Israeli Defense Forces were operating constantly in the West Bank to prevent a Hamas takeover there. The Abraham Accords of 2020 created by diplomacy, not war, new dynamics for peace and security. Might an Arab-Israeli alliance against a common threat, Iran, leading to lasting consequences without recourse to war, short or otherwise? That the Iran/Hamas attacks and hostage-taking of October 2023 would bring forth a massive Israeli response was known. Iran/Hamas calculated that such losses would be acceptable in order to forestall the new Middle East that would emerge if Saudi Arabia joined the Abraham Accords. Netanyahu’s gamble is that Israel can achieve through war against non-state proxy actors what it achieved in previous wars against neighbouring states. It is not obvious that it will be so. State armies can be defeated in battle. Proxy terror networks are never totally eliminated. A year out from October 7, the same question from 1947 remains. Will Israel’s neighbours accept that it should exist in peace and security? The consequence of repeated wars led an increasing number of Arab states to agree. Iran has opted instead for a long proxy war against Israel. This first anniversary should not create confusion that this war is only a year old. The proxy war has been going on for 18 years, since the second Lebanon war in 2006. It’s been a long war with few consequences — yet. National Post",

      "description": "The year since the terror attacks has seen a swell of anti-Israel media subversion, extermination propaganda and outright violence",
      "content": "One year on, Jews in the West have had time to process the primary shock of Hamas’s pogrom in southern Israel and the secondary shock of hateful blowback against Israel and Jews worldwide. We learned in a span of hours that where lethal antisemitism is concerned, “never again” was for us a mere objective, not a guarantee against those consumed by a mission of “again and again and again.” But should we have been so surprised? Gaza was riddled with tunnels, their sole purpose to prepare for a war of extermination against Jews. The West’s intellectual “tunnels” have been operating in plain sight for many years. Under the aegis of “Israel Apartheid Week” and the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, vicious anti-Zionism has been a campus fixture since 2001, when the World Conference against Racism in Durban, South Africa erupted into a “ festival of hate ” against Jews. After decades of aggressive Israel-bashing, Palestinians have been elevated throughout western educational systems to the summit of intersectional victimhood. Those indoctrinated in this hierarchy over the last 25 years consider it a duty and a virtue to demonize Zionism as an original historical sin. October 7 popped the cork on that long-seething volcano. Throughout the past year, we’ve seen hostage posters vandalized, Jewish schoolchildren bullied, Jewish-owned businesses attacked, Jewish neighbourhoods tormented, Jewish institutions burned and shot at. Downtowns are routinely plagued by foul-mouthed protesters shrieking mantras that call for Israel’s elimination. University campuses have tolerated long-term encampments, Judenrein except for Jews who earn their laissez-passer with a denunciation of Israel. It’s getting worse . On Saturday in Toronto, a demonstration featured Hezbollah flags, banners extolling violence against Israel and portraits of the (recently eliminated) Hezbollah leader and arch-terrorist Hassan Nasrallah. Last Sunday in Montreal, a band of black-garbed protesters attacked Concordia University and smashed several downtown store windows. During a foot chase, one even threw Molotov cocktails in the direction of police, an ominous escalation. More ominous in my opinion: Post-October 7, we saw the emergence at rallies and on western social media of the image of a Jewish star being dumped into a trash can accompanied by the words “Keep the world clean” — for years a meme favoured by Hamas, inspired by the Nazis. The Nazis used the image and words in their propaganda to normalize the idea that Jews, like vermin, were a hygiene threat requiring drastic action to preserve the nation’s health. That such messages are tolerated in the public forum points to a growing acceptance of outright eradicationist antisemitism as a “respectable” opinion to hold, even among supposedly enlightened people in fields such as mental health, as evidenced by anti-Zionist blacklists targeting Jewish members of the profession. No institution has played a more pernicious role in enabling Jewish scapegoatism than western media. In long 2014 articles for The Atlantic and Tablet , Canadian-Israeli journalist Matti Friedman famously chronicled the mutations in reportage and commentary that reflected “a change not in the news but in the newsroom,” when political activism usurped the principle of objectivity in Israel coverage. In a Free Press piece last month, Friedman reprises his ever more relevant theme of near industry-wide subversion of professional journalism by anti-Zionist activism. Through the cherry-picking of facts, deliberate exclusion of necessary context and “reversing cause and effect,” left-leaning media determined that Israel was to be portrayed as a country “whose motivations could only be malevolent, and one responsible not only for its own actions but also for provoking the actions of its enemies.” Media like the BBC and the CBC don’t make “errors,” Friedman says, and sending them “corrections” on their anti-Israel coverage won’t help. “Those aren’t errors,” Friedman writes. “They’re the result of the press doing a different job correctly.” The “different job” he refers to is the perpetuation of the myth that Jews are inextricably bound up with the human rights evils of our era — racism, apartheid and colonialism. There is no question in Friedman’s mind that over the last decade, “the growing derangement about Israel and the plummeting credibility of the press ... are related phenomena.” To conclude this October 7 first-year anniversary column on a personal note, I cannot overstate my gratitude, in these turbulent and dismaying circumstances, for my affiliation with the National Post, one of the few national newspapers in the West that has never succumbed to the far-left mind virus that battens on scapegoatism. Freedom to vigorously defend Zionism and Israel in my columns has been an enormous comfort to me over the past year. I owe this freedom to our editor-in-chief, Rob Roberts. Rob has demonstrated intellectual independence and moral courage in standing up to many of the irrational mass delusions of our era, including anti-Zionism. And so it is fitting that on Oct. 15, Rob — also representing Postmedia, which has backed his editorial policy to the hilt — will receive an award for his professional integrity from the Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation. It will be my privilege to present him with this much-deserved laurel. Kol ha kovod, Rob. All honour to you. National Post kaybarb@gmail.com X.com: @BarbaraRKay",

      "description": "Special counsel Jack Smith's filing is a disaster foretold: Trump in 2024 is chillingly replicating the lies that led to the 2021 insurrection.",
      "content": "The unsealing last week of the government’s case against Donald Trump for trying to overturn his 2020 election loss was a gift to 2024 voters, reviving attention to perhaps the single biggest reason he shouldn’t be restored to office. New and sordid details, in particular from former Vice President Mike Pence, freshen what is mostly a familiar account of Trump’s post-election plotting to stay in power. It’s damning, if not so completely as a trial would have been (and, I’d wager, a conviction), had Trump not succeeded in his delaying tactics all the way to the oh-so-friendly Supreme Court. But the filing made public Tuesday in Washington’s federal court is valuable, too, as a reminder of what Trump was doing in the months before the 2020 election. Chillingly, his activities back then — falsely alleging myriad ways Democrats would cheat, suggesting he’d challenge the result if he lost to Joe Biden — parallel to what he is doing now as he campaigns against Kamala Harris. Here’s how special counsel Jack Smith opens the narrative against Trump: “Although his multiple conspiracies began after election day in 2020, the defendant laid the groundwork for his crimes well before then.” Smith goes on: “He refused to say whether he would accept the election results, insisted that he could lose the election only because of fraud, falsely claimed that mail-in ballots were inherently fraudulent, and asserted that only votes counted by election day were valid.” Voters, be forewarned. We’re watching a sequel. And they’re usually worse than the original. The government provides examples of Trump’s 2020 campaign antics that are all too familiar now. There was his response in a July 2020 interview, when Fox News’ Chris Wallace (now at CNN) repeatedly asked if he would accept the results of the election. He’d “have to see,” the then-president said. “It depends.” Just last Tuesday, a reporter in battleground Wisconsin asked the election-denying candidate, “Do you trust the process this time around?” Trump: “I’ll let you know in about 33 days.” In his debate against Biden, Trump said, after the moderator’s third attempt at asking the question, that he’d accept the outcome if it were a “fair and legal and good election.” Just as in 2020 and 2016, Trump always has an “if.” Translation: “ If I win.” Let’s pause to remember American Politics B.T. (Before Trump): We campaign reporters never thought to ask a presidential candidate, or a contender for any office, if they’d accept the election result. And if we had, I daresay no serious politician would have suggested they wouldn’t. Back to the parallels between pre-election 2020 and 2024. Smith’s filing against Trump recalled that throughout his 2020 campaign, he told the MAGA faithful just what he told a national TV audience at the Republican National Convention that year: “The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election.” Four years later, at a rally in Erie, Pa. , last Sunday, Trump ranted that Democrats were like criminals in “the way they cheat at elections.” In a recent, and typical, fundraising email, he told backers, “Kamala ordered her Silicon Valley henchmen to censor free speech & rig the election.” And his response to the release of the government filing? “They rigged the election.” Then there’s Trump’s lies about mail-in ballots. In July 2020, the Smith filing notes, “despite having voted by mail himself earlier that year,” he tweeted that because of mail-in votes, “2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history.” Trump now echoes that lie at nearly every rally and in frequent social media posts, even as his party desperately tries to get its members to vote early by mail — including at rallies where Trump assails the practice. He recently told reporters that mail-in ballots are “a whole big scam,” and the same day posted that Democrats were (legally) getting Americans living overseas to vote by mail, adding, “Actually, they are getting ready to CHEAT!” Trump repeatedly condemns Democrats for “election interference.” He lies that they’re getting noncitizen migrants to vote, a vanishingly rare occurrence that is against federal law. NBC News on Thursday reported more than a dozen examples of Trump’s evidence-free allegations of fraud before a single vote was cast. Déjà vu all over again. Thanks should go to Smith and to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who unsealed most of his filing. The revival of the story of Trump’s 2020 election subversion and incitement of a bloody insurrection underscores America’s predicament: Unless Trump is defeated in the 2024 election, not only will he likely never be held criminally accountable for his alleged crimes, but , restored to the presidency, he’d be more emboldened to ignore all guardrails of democracy and the rule of law. On Thursday, Never Trump stalwart and exiled Republican royalty Rep. Liz Cheney appeared onstage with Harris in Ripon, Wis., the pre-Civil War birthplace of the antislavery Republican Party in 1854. “In this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration. It is our duty,” Cheney said. “I ask all of you here and everyone listening across this great country to join us. I ask you to meet this moment. I ask you to stand in truth, to reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump.” I’m not so naive as to think any words will move Trump’s devoted followers. And yet we can hope that such sentiments as Cheney’s can influence others. Because Trump must not only be defeated, but beaten so decisively that he cannot plausibly contest the election’s outcome. @jackiekcalmes",

      "description": "Controversial culture war issues are on the docket, but here's the big question: Will the justices play a decisive role in electing Kamala Harris or Donald Trump?",
      "content": "What role, if any, will the Supreme Court play in the November presidential election? That is the crucial, unknowable question, as the court returns from its summer recess on Oct. 7. Will this be an election like 2000, when the Supreme Court in effect decided the outcome with its decision in Bush vs. Gore? Or will this be like 2020, when the court had no decisive role in the outcome of a very close presidential election? So much turns on whether the election comes down to one state, as it did in Florida in 2000, and whether there are constitutional issues for the court to resolve that could make it the final arbiter. Also, how much will the future composition of the Supreme Court matter to the voters in November? The most long-lasting legacy of any president is his or her picks for the Supreme Court and the federal bench. If Hillary Clinton rather than Donald Trump had won the 2016 presidential election, and if she had chosen three justices rather than Trump, the law would be dramatically different: Roe vs. Wade would not have been overruled, the court would not have ended affirmative action in higher education, there would not have been the dramatic expansion of gun rights, and the court would not have imposed dramatic new limits on the power of administrative agencies. This election, too, could matter for the composition of the court for decades to come. If Trump wins, and there is a Republican Senate, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., both in their 70s, are likely to retire. This would let Trump pick two justices who could be in their late 40s and early 50s, cementing an ultraconservative majority for a long time. Conversely, if Kamala Harris wins, and there is a Democratic majority in the Senate, Justice Sonia Sotomayor might step down to allow a younger liberal-leaning jurist to take her place. As the justices begin the new term, there are 28 cases already on the docket. This is about half of the number that will be decided between now and July; the remainder will be granted review from early October and mid-January. Of the cases so far, it’s striking how many touch on issues related to American culture wars — emotional issues that deeply divide conservatives and liberals. For example, United States vs. Skrmetti involves the constitutionality of a Tennessee law that prohibits gender-affirming care for transgender individuals under age 18. The case will matter enormously for transgender youth in the United States. A recent study concluded: “As of May 2024, 39% or 117,600 trans youth aged 13-17 are living in the 25 states that have passed bans on gender-affirming care.” In more general terms, it will reveal how this court thinks discrimination against transgender individuals should be treated under the Constitution. Free Speech Coalition vs. Paxton involves a Texas law that requires websites where “more than one-third” of the content is “sexual material harmful to minors” to “verify that an individual attempting to access the [covered] material is 18 years of age or older.” These websites also must warn viewers about the harms of exposure to pornography. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the age verification requirement but struck down the warning labels. The Supreme Court in the past has allowed restrictions on access by minors to sexually explicit materials but never limited adults. In 2011, the justices stressed the 1st Amendment rights of minors and declared unconstitutional a California law prohibiting them from having, renting or purchasing violent video games without parental consent. Guns, too, are an issue where the country is deeply split. Garland vs. Vanderstock involves the legality of a federal prohibition against ghost guns — privately produced guns without serial numbers. The case concerns a 2022 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulation. The appeals court, the conservative 5th Circuit again, struck down the regulation as exceeding the bureau’s authority. The case does not involve the 2nd Amendment, but rather a government agency’s authorization to make rules. Although there certainly is a compelling law enforcement need to set boundaries on ghost guns, the Supreme Court is both sympathetic to gun rights and hostile to administrative regulations. And for the first time in several years, the court has a major case about the death penalty on its docket. What makes Glossip vs. Oklahoma unusual is that Oklahoma has conceded error and acknowledged the state’s violation of the Constitution in not disclosing key evidence to the defense in the trial of Richard Glossip, who is now on death row for commissioning a murder. Oklahoma agreed that Glossip should get a new trial, but the state Court of Criminal Appeals refused to allow it, despite requests from the prosecution and the defendant. The Supreme Court is being asked to agree or disagree that Glossip’s execution should go forward. The division among the justices on the Supreme Court, with six conservative justices appointed by Republican presidents and three liberal justices appointed by Democratic presidents, will matter in many of these cases. It may also be the deciding factor in the November presidential election. Erwin Chemerinsky is a contributing writer to Opinion and the dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law.",

      "description": "Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino is fighting with the city of Amsterdam, New York, to display a 100-foot \"Vote for Trump\" sign visible from the New York State Thruway.",
      "content": "Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino spoke to Fox News Digital about his efforts to post a large ‘Vote for Trump’ sign on top of a building in Amsterdam, New York, and the mayor's efforts to stop it. A 100-foot wide \"Vote for Trump\" sign in upstate New York is stirring controversy after the City of Amsterdam claimed it's a big, glowing code violation. Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino told Fox News Digital he installed the sign on top of the old Fownes glove factory to symbolize the return of American manufacturing and what he calls \"the triumph of the underdog against insurmountable adversity.\" \"I think that's what President Trump did. He triumphed against massive adversity. He's still doing that with bullets flying by his head,\" Constantino said. \"And we triumph too. Nobody thought we could build a massive sticker company or a massive tech company in upstate New York.\" But his company now faces adversity in the form of legal action by the City of Amsterdam to prevent the \"displaying\" and \"illumination\" of the pro-Trump sign, which is visible from the New York State Thruway. TRUMP'S RETURN TO BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, SITE OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, IS ‘GUTSY,’ SUPPORTERS SAY Sticker Mule installed a 100-foot \"Vote for Trump\" sign on the tallest building in Amsterdam, N.Y. (Sticker Mule) According to court documents, the sign violates city code because it \"presents a dangerous distraction and impacts traffic flow,\" especially at night when it is illuminated. Local officials allege Sticker Mule was informed it would need a permit and several variances to install the sign in August, but the company never responded before the sign went up Oct. 1. Constantino and his legal team contest the city's claims. The CEO believes Amsterdam's Democratic Party-endorsed independent mayor is anti-Trump and has vowed to fight a temporary injunction that requires the sign to be covered up. Amsterdam Mayor Michael Cinquanti did not respond to requests for comment. Dressed in a black T-shirt that said \"Trump For Peace,\" Constantino describes Sticker Mule as \"the internet's fastest growing printing company\" with 1,200 employees in 39 countries. His online business began by making stickers but has since expanded to print T-shirts, buttons and magnets and even operates its own online store platform, Sticker Mule Stores. He is proud to report that Sticker Mule has created nearly 1,000 manufacturing jobs in the U.S. over the past few years. \"I like to move fast and do interesting things,\" Constantino told Fox News Digital. Success in business gave him the means to reinvest in his hometown of Amsterdam, and the Fownes factory was one of several buildings he bought and restored, filling them with machines and workers. FORMER NFL STAR AND TRUMP SUPPORTER ANTONIO BROWN JOINS VOTER REGISTRATION EFFORT IN KEY SWING STATE Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino speaks at an event in New York. (Paul Antonelli) \"Fownes was a glove manufacturer that left my hometown when I was 2 years old in 1984,\" he said, explaining that Amsterdam was \"decimated\" by job loss when the factory, with its iconic \"Fownes\" sign, closed its doors. \"This Fownes sign for years symbolized American manufacturing going to China,\" Constantino said. Now, the $150,000 \"Vote for Trump\" sign sits in its place, heralding a new era of American manufacturing jobs . The impossible-to-miss sign attracted \"major interest,\" according to Constantino. To celebrate its installation, his political action committee, StickerPAC, plans to host a \"Trump Sign Lighting Party\" Oct. 7 at 6 p.m. A news release about the event says UFC superstars Henry Cejudo, Kelvin Gastelum and Tracy Cortez will join Constantino to speak and support the \"historic event.\" According to a representative for Constantino, House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is also expected to speak at the event. Stefanik's office did not respond to a request for comment. \"The enthusiasm just went through the roof. We've got three UFC superstars that wanted to come see it. We've got people that want to come from all over the state of New York, people that want to fly in or drive in from all over the country, really, to see the sign get lit up,\" Constantino said. ‘TIGHTEST RACE SINCE 2000’: HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN HITS FINAL STRETCH UNTIL ELECTION DAY The \"Vote for Trump\" sign in Amsterdam, N.Y., has been covered after a court-issued injunction. (Paul Antonelli) But the festivities may be cut short by legal action from Amsterdam. On Oct. 3, the city code enforcer sent a notice of violation to Sticker Mule that gave the company two days to remove the \"Vote for Trump\" sign. The city also requested an injunction from the Supreme Court of the State of New York to prevent the sign from being displayed. \"The affidavit claims, without evidence, that the city will suffer irreparable harm because the sign is a dangerous distraction for drivers due to its novelty and the fear that people will stop to take pictures of it,\" said Sal Ferlazzo, general counsel for Sticker Mule. \"The court, based solely on the city's presentation and without any opportunity for me to respond, did initially grant a preliminary injunction and restraining order.\" A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 8 at 10 a.m. Until that time, the court ordered Sticker Mule to refrain from \"displaying any sign and/or illumination of any sign on the roof of 26 Elk Street.\" On the advice of legal counsel, Sticker Mule has temporarily covered up the pro-Trump sign to comply with the court order. TRUMP-VANCE TICKET HAS DONE COMBINED 63 INTERVIEWS SINCE AUGUST COMPARED TO 24 FOR HARRIS-WALZ The illuminated \"Vote for Trump\" sign at 26 Elk St., Amsterdam, N.Y. (@stickermule | Instagram) \"I think it's deeply disturbing,\" Constantino said of the city's action. \"I brought nearly a thousand jobs to my hometown, which was decimated when the Fownes company and other companies left. And I'm trying to do something positive, exciting for the community.\" He suggested Mayor Cinquanti has \"TDS\" — Trump derangement syndrome — and is fighting the sign for political reasons. \"They do know that they are in violation,\" Cinquanti told The Daily Gazette. \"They've been cited, and we'll just let that play out as we would with any code violation.\" The mayor, who according to the newspaper has previously called Trump his least favorite president in American history, insisted the city's objections to the sign are about safety, not politics. \"I don't care what the sign says, but distracting the attention of drivers on the freeway is something that needs to be looked at, and that's what we're doing,\" he told the outlet. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Any sign that represents a hazard to the safety of drivers concerns me,\" he added. \"Anyone who violates city codes is an issue that we deal with, and we are in the process of dealing with it and trying to alleviate what I consider a hazard.\" Regardless of the city's objections, Constantino said Monday's event will continue as planned, \"featuring UFC Superstars, Free Fish Filets, Cybertrucks and a beautiful Trump sign.\" \"The sign is a beautiful sign whether you're a Democrat or Republican. The sign is a big win for upstate New York, a big win for Amsterdam, New York. It's a beautiful and uplifting sign. And I think it's going to become a major tourist attraction, especially if Trump wins,\" Constantino said. \"It's going to be a unifying event. I'm inviting Democrats and Republicans alike to come watch me unveil the sign. We don't want all the division going on in this country anymore.\" Chris Pandolfo is a writer for Fox News Digital.

      "content": "To the editor: No praise is due to Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Trump for dropping by a disaster zone before an election. Empathy will only carry us so much before we realize that infrastructure as well as structure are in bad shape. (“ Missiles, a hurricane and a strike: How 3 crises are shaping the presidential race ,” Oct. 2) Thank you, Vice President Harris, but exactly how will you deliver real aid? On the other side, attacking the elected government for failure when the hurricane is barely gone is a cheap, blatant and very boring trick performed on cue by Trump to fire up people who are hurting. In a tragic way, it is comical for a climate-change denier like Trump to call out his opponent for causing death and destruction due to alteration of the global environment. He is the undisputed chief agent for fake science and a failed COVID-19 response that killed thousands of Americans. The winner of the worst response to a hurricane: Donald Trump. Michael Gross, Woodland Hills .. To the editor: The Times printed a photo of Trump visiting hurricane-ravaged areas on its front page. Of course, he visited the area not to help the people, but for political reasons. He used his visit to make false claims about the federal response to the crisis. During his term as president, he diverted funding from federal disaster response. Project 2025, the controversial blueprint for the next Republican administration, calls for restructuring the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reduce aid to states in need. Separately, he stated that he would revoke legal status for Haitian immigrants in the U.S. and said we should have a day of violence to rid our country of crime. But by all means, print a photo of him above the fold showing him supposedly delivering aid to the area. April Wilson, Riverside",

      "description": "Donald Trump's racial insults belong to a lengthy history of false, fantastical and contradictory claims",
      "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email In the spring of 1892, Ida B. Wells had had enough. The 29-year-old Memphis editor was sick of reading about the lynchings of Black Americans and angry about the bogus excuse often used to justify them: fraudulent claims of sexual assault — “the same old racket,” as she called it. “Nobody in this section of the country believes the old thread-bare lie that Negro men rape white women.” And so she set out to convince other Americans. Wells collected data for hundreds of cases, investigated dozens herself and even hired private investigators, and carefully tracked and catalogued how those cases were reported. What she found was a concerted newspaper campaign of false propaganda that encouraged lynching and then excused or covered it up. Wells muckraked the failings of the press, in other words. And her exposés of racist lies form a crucial part of the history of disinformation in America. That’s not the way I originally conceived such a history, though. In trying to chronicle media malpractice in America for a book, I expected to cover infamous hoaxes, such as the New York Sun’s batmen-on-the-moon series in 1835 or the New York Herald’s fictitious zoo escape of 1874, which featured rampaging grizzlies and bloodthirsty panthers. I also anticipated writing about conspiracy theories, like the various “Satanic panics” and QAnon, along with notorious examples of partisan deception, whether in the 1790s or today. But in doing the research, I kept seeing cases like Wells’ critique, and that changed my entire frame of reference. Related Donald Trump and JD Vance: Decoding a double dose of right-wing racism The most consequential part of the history of disinformation in America, it soon became obvious, isn’t the episodic lying driven by pranking or profit. Instead, it’s the longstanding “bipartisan” myths that have targeted marginalized groups: women, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ communities, labor unions, the poor and others. These lies have proved far more enduring and much more lethal. Disinformation about Black people is one of the oldest traditions in America. It turns out that, for centuries, what white people have said and written about communities of color was false, fantastical, unfair and often self-contradictory. This is evident in the many oxymoronic myths spread about African Americans. One of the first of those was that slavery was benign and enslaved persons were generally well-treated. Why, then, did so many try to escape, protest or revolt? Other lies asserted that Black people weren’t as smart or chaste or hardworking as white people, even though many examples to the contrary abounded, and even though the entire Southern plantation economy was sustained by forced labor under the most brutal conditions. For generations after slavery, white writers routinely disparaged the Black family, claiming it wasn’t as strong or as wholesome as their own. They called African-American men “beasts,” portraying them as dangerous predators barely able to contain their impulses to rape, pillage and kill. This was the infuriating hypocrisy that drove Wells to set the record straight. She was perhaps America’s first great investigative journalist. But the lies didn’t end in the Jim Crow era. They persisted through the 20th century, rearing their heads anytime racists needed to push back against the progress of civil rights. And they had many skillful practitioners. For centuries, what white people have said and written about communities of color was false, fantastical, unfair and often self-contradictory. Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett was one of the most convincing liars of his day. In the wake of the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, he gave a televised speech announcing his intention to fight the ruling. Barnett insisted that no school in the state would integrate — and couldn’t be forced to, he claimed, because Mississippi’s sovereign power superseded the federal government’s. That’s not what he told the public, however. “Of course I know interposition is invalid,” he admitted. “I’m bluffing. But you wait and see. I’ll bluff the Justice Department into backing down.” Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus also practiced doublespeak. After reversing his public position on segregation several times, he snapped to reporters: “Just because I said it doesn’t make it so.” That same lack of truthfulness becomes clear in the media's sensationalistic coverage of drug use. Long before the manufactured myth of the “crack baby” epidemic of the 1980s, which was altogether unsupported by evidence, many newspapers in the early 20th century peddled the narrative that cocaine was the African-American drug of choice. “Negro cocaine fiends” was a fearsome trope the press loved to brandish, even though the vast majority of cocaine users then were white. For too many editors, the combination of Black criminality and exotic substances was a potent elixir, something that Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry Anslinger exploited in his openly racist public relations strategy and selective enforcement. Anslinger was one of the greatest con men of that century, and racist canards were his stock in trade. We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism Disinformation about people of color never disappeared. It has flourished on talk radio, on Fox News and on websites like Newsmax and Breitbart, which for a time featured a “Black Crime” menu option and regularly traffics in stories about “illegals,” the “border crisis” and “migrant crime.” Outlets with no journalistic ethics don’t just happen to dabble in these fictions; they bank on them. Disinformation is part of their business model. Into this fraught media ecosphere strolled Donald Trump. From his “birther” conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States, to his insults targeting Muslims, Mexicans, Black Lives Matter activists and others, Trump milks racial animosity regularly, hawking lies about people of color at nearly every rally. He, too, is a kind of racketeer. His attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris often descend to insults about her identity — that she’s not Black or too Black or in some way not sufficiently American — but mostly they lump her in with the myths so often told about African Americans, essentially that they’re deficient in some way and thus not equal to white citizens. Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter , Crash Course. Only in America can a white man convicted of multiple felonies try to paint a Black former prosecutor as a criminal. Only in America can a trust-fund heir with numerous bankruptcies and and an endless list of lawsuits accuse a former McDonald’s employee of privilege. Only in America can a “businessman” with financial ties to the Russian mob suggest others are corrupt. When Alexander Hamilton contemplated recruiting African-American soldiers to fight in the Revolutionary War, he recognized the resistance that would ensue from many white people. As he lamented, “The contempt we have been taught to entertain for the blacks makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor in experience.” Those delusions die hard. Too many white Americans today still fail to see clearly, and continue to chase phantoms instead of reality. If Ida B. Wells were alive today, she’d be fighting for facts and challenging the dishonest schemers. So should we all.

      "description": "The University of Notre Dame’s law school is an institution increasingly exerting conservative influence on the Supreme Court.",
      "content": "SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Tucked within a Gothic-style building on campus in this small town is a Catholic institution increasingly exerting conservative influence on the Supreme Court: the University of Notre Dame Law School. The school counts among its former faculty Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who swapped the faux-medieval halls of one institution for the neoclassical marble columns of another in helping form the 6-3 conservative majority on the court. In a trend that started before Barrett’s appointment but has accelerated since, the school is now having success placing both students and professors in prestigious Supreme Court clerkships. The clerks serve one-year terms and play a low-profile but crucial role in advising their bosses on which cases to take up and how to rule on them. They do research, help craft decisions and serve as sounding boards for the justices. The nation’s elite law schools — particularly Harvard and Yale — have dominated filling clerkships at the Supreme Court and educating the lawyers who went on to be nominated to the court for decades. In the competition for students and prestige, law schools have worked to propel their students into clerk jobs. Conservative criticism of academia, particularly targeting the nation’s elite universities, has grown, presenting an opening for more conservative-minded schools to gain prominence with a more conservative court. Hiring clerks from law schools steeped in the prevailing conservative thinking known as originalism — a philosophy often frowned upon in more liberal-leaning law schools — ensures that the justices who hire them have like-minded aides who have been armed by their professors with novel legal approaches on the most pressing issues. Originalist theories have underpinned some of the court’s biggest rulings in recent years, including the decision that overturned abortion rights landmark Roe v. Wade and others that have controversially expanded the right to own firearms. The relationship produced by Notre Dame faculty helps seed conservative legal theories. Professors are also involved in crafting litigation that can make its way before the court dealing with causes that are popular on the right, such as those encompassed by the term “religious liberty.” Several Notre Dame professors, for example, filed briefs in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case urging the justices to overturn Roe. One of those briefs, filed by a retired Notre Dame professor, John Finnis, was cited by conservative Justice Samuel Alito in the 2022 ruling. Separately, the school’s religious liberty clinic has cases before the high court, including one pending appeal urging the justices to endorse a taxpayer-funded Catholic charter school in Oklahoma in a direct challenge to the separation of church and state. The exchange goes both ways. Justices, mostly conservatives but at times liberals too, have become frequent visitors and guest lecturers at the school, which prides itself on being a safe space for conservatives. Within the last two years, Barrett and fellow conservative Brett Kavanaugh have both been on campus, as has liberal Justice Elena Kagan. It is not unusual for law schools to have personal connections with justices. Kagan, for example, previously served as dean of Harvard Law School. Several justices regularly teach classes at different law schools. The school has become “a bastion for conservative Catholic principles,” said Marci Hamilton, a former Supreme Court law clerk for the late Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and a professor who studies religion at the University of Pennsylvania. ‘Doesn’t openly discriminate’ On a recent late-summer day, all eyes in South Bend were focused on the upcoming home game of the storied Notre Dame football team, with groundskeepers on the campus north of the city steadily at work before thousands of Fighting Irish fans descended from around the country. Members of the football team could be seen jogging to the practice facility while other students headed to class. The law school building is just yards from the golden-domed administrative building and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart Church, two centerpieces of the campus along with the iconic football stadium. Seated in his book-lined study on the second floor, the law school’s dean, G. Marcus Cole, alternated between pride at recent achievements and indignation at the idea that the faculty skews disproportionately to the right. The problem, he said, is that most law schools lean heavily to the left and do not reflect America as a whole. “Half the American people could be characterized as conservative. Half the legal profession can be characterized as conservative. In fact, there’s nothing wrong with being conservative. It’s normal. It’s normal everywhere except for in the legal academy,” he said. At some other law schools “it is a badge of dishonor” to have any conservatives on the faculty, which does not serve students well, he added. Among the Notre Dame faculty are well-connected conservative husband and wife duo Richard and Nicole Garnett; O. Carter Snead, known for his scholarship opposing abortion rights; and William Kelley, who clerked for the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and served in the administration of President George W. Bush. Several other professors clerked for conservative justices. “I’m happy that we’re one of the few law schools in America that doesn’t openly discriminate against conservatives,” Cole said. He also expressed pride in Barrett’s achievements. He was among a Notre Dame delegation that was present at a celebratory Rose Garden event at the White House when then-President Donald Trump announced her nomination amid the Covid-19 pandemic just before the 2020 election. Opinions vary on just how conservative-leaning the law school is, with current faculty and some students saying it is ideologically diverse and some former professors and students saying there is a clear tilt to the right. Mark McKenna, a former Notre Dame Law School professor now at the UCLA School of Law in California, said he saw a clear shift to the right during his time there from 2008 to 2021. He says he left in part because he found his own liberal views to be out of step with the views of his colleagues. The school’s success in securing clerkships with conservative justices and prominent lower court judges will only serve to deepen that reputation, with conservative students eager to benefit and get a head-start in their legal careers, he said. “This is definitely going to make Notre Dame a sustaining feature of the Federalist Society infrastructure,” McKenna added, in reference to the conservative legal group that has become a key incubator for future judges and Supreme Court justices. Annie Ortega, a third-year student who recently took a weeklong class taught by Barrett, praised the “ideologically diverse” school. She is president of the school’s chapter of the Federalist Society but said she has lively conversations with her many liberal friends at the school. “Going to a law school where I was going to hear both sides of the conversation was really important, and is something that I found to be true in my class,” she added. Joshua Mannery, a recent graduate who leans liberal and served as president of the student bar association, said that while he did not feel excluded, “I do think anybody who says it’s more conservative is not wrong in saying that.” ‘Cream of the crop’ Each of the nine Supreme Court justices hires four clerks a year. It is considered the most prestigious post a recent law school graduate can obtain. “These are considered the cream of the crop, the best in the legal profession,” said Aliza Shatzman, president of the Legal Accountability Project, a group she formed to help improve transparency in the clerkship process amid concerns about workplace bullying and harassment. During the year, the clerks work on all the biggest cases before the court on issues like abortion, guns, voting rights and LGBTQ rights. Once the clerkship is completed, the clerks are in high demand in the legal profession, with big law firms offering eye-popping signing bonuses . Many clerks go on to high-profile careers, whether in corporate law, academia or in some cases politics. Later in their careers, they are often earmarked as potential judicial appointees. Of the current nine justices, six clerked at the court, as have several prominent senators, including Republicans Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo. In the coming nine-month term that officially starts on Monday, two recent Notre Dame Law School graduates, Kari Lorentson and Elizabeth Totzke, are both clerking for Barrett. And two law professors from the school, Christian Burset and Patrick Reidy, the latter of whom is a Catholic priest, are clerking for justices Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, respectively. They are following in the footsteps of four other Notre Dame graduates who clerked at the high court in the last five years, all for conservative justices. Two other Notre Dame professors also clerked at the Supreme Court in recent years, both with Gorsuch, who appears to sometimes favor hiring academics to work for him. In an appearance at Notre Dame last year, Kavanaugh spoke about what he looks for in his clerks. “It’s got to be people who are comfortable with my general approach,” Kavanaugh said. “I have had two spectacular Notre Dame law clerks. They just worked so hard.” Nicole Garnett, a longtime Notre Dame professor who clerked for conservative Justice Clarence Thomas and is a longtime friend of Barrett’s , chairs the school’s clerkship committee. In an interview, she downplayed connections with the conservative justices. “I think that drawing any conclusions about Supreme Court clerkships is probably a category error because it’s such a needle-in-a-haystack, lightning-strike kind of thing,” she said. In 2023, Notre Dame was ranked fourth in the country at placing students in clerkships at all levels of the court system. Overall, Notre Dame ranked 20th in the most recent U.S. News & World Report law school rankings. The traditional elite law schools dominate Supreme Court clerkships, with many justices hiring clerks from the same law schools they themselves attended and maintaining close links with faculty members. About two-thirds of clerks come from five schools: Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Columbia and the University of Chicago. Barrett, who graduated from Notre Dame Law School, is the only member of the current court not to have a law degree from Harvard or Yale. Within that context, Notre Dame is scrapping with other law schools for the remaining clerkships and has performed well. In the last five years, more graduates of Notre Dame Law School have been clerking at the high court than from many other high-ranking law schools, including Duke University, the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University. Another conservative-aligned law school that is making inroads is George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School in Virginia, which has also placed some graduates in Supreme Court clerkships. While Supreme Court clerkships are the most sought-after, similar roles with federal appeals court judges are also important, in part because many people who later obtain clerkships at the high court have previously worked for a lower court judge. Notre Dame is making inroads on that front too. Of the most recent graduating class of 187 students, about 20% moved on to clerkships of some type. ‘I’m Catholic’ During an appearance at a Federalist Society event in Washington last year, Barrett was asked what attracted her to Notre Dame. “I’m a little bit hesitant to bring this up,” Barrett said. “I’m not sure if you know, but I’m Catholic.” The audience of conservative lawyers laughed knowingly. Barrett’s Catholic faith was much-discussed when Trump appointed her to the high court in 2020 especially as it relates to abortion, which the Catholic Church opposes. Two years later, she was part of the majority that voted to overturn Roe. Barrett, who at the same event praised Notre Dame for its “support for faith and family” and “fantastic faculty colleagues,” is not the only Catholic justice. Of the current nine justices, Kagan, who is Jewish, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is Protestant, are the only ones who were not raised Catholic. In his recent Notre Dame appearance, Kavanaugh praised the “Catholic tradition of service to others” that the university as a whole embodies. “A lot of what I learned in the Catholic school still informs — not my jurisprudence, so I don’t want to confuse the issue, not my jurisprudence — but just how I try to treat other people and how I think of my role in public service,” he said. Both Kavanaugh and Barrett declined via a court spokeswoman to comment further on the law school’s growing influence. Justices are not required to step aside from cases based purely on their religious beliefs, just as there is no religious test for anyone who serves as a justice. Greg Lipper, a lawyer who previously worked for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, a group that advocates against religion in public life, said the professional and personal ties that some justices have with Notre Dame are similar to those that all judges have based on their experiences before taking the bench. Hamilton, the University of Pennsylvania professor, said the Notre Dame Law School reflects a “growing cadre” of conservative Catholics in public life. That movement has had its greatest success in the legal arena, thanks in part to the efforts of Leonard Leo, the legal activist and conservative Catholic who advised Trump and other Republican presidents on Supreme Court appointments. When Thomas visited Notre Dame in 2021, he spoke at the university’s Center for Citizenship and Constitutional Government, which receives funding from the Napa Institute, a Catholic group that Leo is associated with . “The money-powered Catholic right should be troubling to a lot of Americans,” Hamilton said. The church’s teachings inform the school’s religious liberty clinic, founded during Cole’s tenure, which is actively involved in cases around the country that could reach the Supreme Court. The current court is solicitous of religious claims as shown in recent rulings, including a series of decisions that have eroded the separation of church and state. The clinic came under scrutiny two years ago when it paid for Alito to travel to Rome for a religious liberty summit it organizes every year. Alito made headlines by delivering a speech in which he mocked foreign leaders who had criticized the Supreme Court’s decision to curb abortion rights. Alito contended at the time that the trip was separate from the clinic. The justices are due to consider in the coming months whether to take up the clinic’s case on Oklahoma’s attempt to use state funds to open a Catholic school, the nation’s first religious public charter school. The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the plan was unconstitutional. The clinic has also backed religious liberty in cases not driven by Catholics, including another case now pending at the Supreme Court over a claim that Native American religious rights would be violated if land in Arizona is used to build a copper mine. Other law schools with clinics also regularly have cases before the justices. Under ethics rules, justices are not required to step aside from cases involving law school clinics at schools they have ties with. Cole doesn’t see the school’s involvement as being a conservative push. While professors filed briefs arguing in favor of the Supreme Court overturning Roe, the school also has professors who oppose the death penalty, assist immigrants and help people convicted of felonies with exoneration claims, he added. “These are not conservative issues. They’re Catholic issues,” Cole said.",

      "description": "Oversharing is only a good thing when done by amusing people",
      "content": "As an only child, one of the lazy cliches I’ve had to withstand about my kind over the years is that we don’t share. This is outrageous; I’ve always encouraged my husbands to commit adultery – especially if I can watch – and I’m a notorious picker-up of tabs , spending a fortune down the decades on people I’ve invited to share my largesse. I love to “overshare” too – that is, “reveal an inappropriate amount of detail about one’s personal life” – but with the proviso that this occurrence has to be at least amusing, at best shocking. Often, especially if it concerns health, oversharing can be wearing; as a child I grew fearful of coming home from school to find my mother assembled with her cronies, as I knew that they would be spending several hours discussing their own and their friends’ various health travails in lip-licking detail – the best/worst one being: “And then her womb fell out as she got on the bus!” That’s what Facebook’s like these days – a bunch of moaning women one-upping each other on minor ailments. “I’ve got a cyst on my ovary!” remarked one the other day. “I’ve got two – one on each!” another instantly crowed. A sexed-up kissing-cousin of such revelations happens when a bunch of broads – often after a gallon of white wine each – get together to carp about men, preferably their sexual shortcomings. Although I’ve been an absolute ocean-going bitch all my life, I don’t recall ever indulging in this. There’s something so sad about it, despite all the attempts on screens small and large to make it some sort of feminist bonding project . We would despise men who sat around comparing sexual notes about women; it’s no different when we do it to them. Besides, if you spent any amount of time with a man who didn’t please you, it’s you who looks like the prize booby – not him who looks like the booby prize. Read Next I’ve had it with children in posh restaurants – ban them now No, the oversharing I like is the more grandstanding, flamboyant, skilful kind. I’ve earned it. Growing up as a shy, working-class, provincial girl in the 70s, I didn’t dream of true love; I dreamt of being a divorcee and a wit. My heroines weren’t Olivia Newton-John and Pan’s People but Tallulah Bankhead (“I’ve been to bed with men, women and odd pieces of furniture”) and Dorothy Parker (“Ducking for apples – change one letter and that’s the story of my life”). I remember as a youngster reading a flapper in an F Scott Fitzgerald story saying, “You’ve either got to feed people or shock them,” and it really stuck in my mind. A variation of this is “the clever one talks and the rich one pays” which a rich, clever man who took an interest in my writing when I was a dumb and impoverished teenager used to say, and I’ve done my best to become both. In my experience, it doesn’t take much oversharing to shock people. There was that time when, as the hostess of a very dull dinner in a very expensive restaurant, I felt moved to posit the question: “If you had to chose, which kind of dogs are best at sex, do you think? I’d wager Alsatians.” Things certainly livened up after that. But it’s often emotional rather than sexual oversharing which can set the cat among the pigeons. I’m fond of quoting the late Peter Ustinov, who famously said of friendship: “Contrary to general belief, I do not believe that friends are necessarily the people you like best, they are merely the people who get there first.” I’ve always believed that this is even truer of those with whom we become romantically involved; forget all that moony-eyed swill about “The One”, it’s more like “The Queue”, as we work our way through the people we fancy until we find one we don’t have the inclination to leave. You would be amazed at the appalled reaction which my sharing this honestly-held belief gets from seemingly sensible adults, whereas it seems perfectly obvious to me; maybe it’s an only child thing. So to conclude, I’d state that oversharing is only a good thing when done by amusing people; otherwise, the emotion which we struggle to conceal is not shock – but boredom.",

      "description": "It's mostly crowing about couples breaking up and recording bird poo in my hair - but it's a treasured possession",
      "content": "On the evening of 5 February 1952, King George VI ate with his family at Sandringham, and turned in for bed at about 10.30pm. He did not wake up. “It is with the greatest sorrow that we make the following announcement,” began the BBC’s John Snagge during an 11.15am bulletin. In Parliament, condolences from the governments of France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Japan and Iceland were read. Great Tom, a bell at St Paul’s cathedral, tolled every minute for two hours. Rugby and hockey fixtures were postponed. Football crowds sang “Abide With Me”. The Labour MP Richard Crossman, however, was spectacularly unbothered. “No one I have met genuinely feels anything about this,” he wrote in his diary, “except Clem Attlee.” Craig Brown’s new, absolutely massive biography A Voyage Around the Queen is built on these kinds of refractions. Seeing as the late Queen wasn’t one for press conferences, her life is told through the memories of the tens of thousands of people who glanced off her, and much of the peppery stuff comes from diaries. Diaries, as Brown says in his afterword, provide “a welcome buzz” to history that court circulars generally struggle to. People write things they would never say in public: soppy things, waspish things, unintentionally funny things. I kept a diary for the calendar year of 2008, and it’s pretty much entirely in that third category. 14 January: “Bird shat in my hair. Not happy.” 3 June: “Had fun putting leaves on a stick with Lorna and Jack.” 11 December: “Ruddy hell, Lottie is fit.” Once again, worth noting: I was 16. I’d thought it’d be a good idea to record the year I left school for posterity, but 16-year-old me was not doing his bit for posterity. When historians come to survey the noughties, 2008 will boil down to the global financial crisis and Barack Obama . That is not what I was writing about. On Sunday 17 February, the day that Alastair Darling announced Northern Rock was being nationalised, I had my own problems. “Threw Nick’s shoe over a fence,” I recorded. “He then hit me.” On 5 November, president-elect Obama told 240,000 people in Chicago: “While we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism... we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can.” I told my diary: “I think I need to go to more parties.” Read Next Noughties culture is everywhere - because we're still traumatised So no, I don’t think historians will be too troubled by my 2008 diary, which mostly focuses on who fancied who and who I played Mario Kart with. Then again, big things come and go even when the person writing the diary is in the middle of them. George Harrison’s diary entry for 10 January 1969 reads: “Got up went to Twickenham. Rehearsed until lunchtime. Left Beatles . Went home.” He doesn’t record how or why or what he felt, but he does note that he had chips for tea. The real power of a diary, though, is something I’ve only discovered a long time after writing one. It’s a way of taking notice of time passing. You pick up each day at its close, turn it over in your hands, try to make a kind of sense of it. Maybe there’s no sense to be made of it, just a load of stuff that happened; bird poo in your hair, a shoe over a fence. But by taking the time to recall it all, put it in an order, and solidify it all by writing it down, it seems to last longer. It’s impossible for days to run into each other in a blur. Despite every single entry making me want to put the thing in a blender, my 2008 diary is one of my most treasured possessions. It’s often mean and petulant, and the amount of time I spent crowing about couples breaking up is, frankly, pathetic. But it is at least true. I fret that because we keep most little notes and thoughts on our phones and online, historians of our times won’t have that much to sift through. Vast tracts of stuff can just disappear, like when MySpace lost 50 million hours of music by 14 million artists in 2019 . The nonprofit Internet Archive and the Wayback Machine try to preserve websites, but so much goes down the digital plughole. Lately I’ve noticed weeks and months sliding together, and memories getting wobbly and vague. The me of 2008 is not someone I’d want to hang out with. But that year, and the idiot I was then, is alive and colourful in a way that the rest of my teens isn’t. The offhand, unimportant things I bothered to note down bring back that time more powerfully than anything else. That’s why I’m going to start writing a diary again. Maybe when I’m 48, I’ll look back at my diary as a 32-year-old and be mortified all over again. But I’d rather know who I actually was, however embarrassing it is.",

IUML and MLA P V Anvar criticized him, calling the statement derogatory. This controversy arose amid debates over Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's alleged comments on Malappuram.",
      "content": "Left MLA K T Jaleel on Sunday sparked controversy by stating that most of the individuals involved in gold smuggling through the international airport in Malappuram district are from the Muslim community , drawing sharp reactions from the IUML and dissident legislator P V Anvar. In a detailed Facebook post, the ruling MLA said a significant percentage of Muslims involved in crimes like gold smuggling and hawala believe that none of these activities are \"irreligious.\" He also called for the intervention of community leaders to create awareness among members being involved in such crimes. His statement comes amidst a raging political row in the state over Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan 's recent allegedly controversial remarks about the Muslim-dominated district of Malappuram. In the Facebook post, Jaleel noted that regardless of the community the wrongdoers belong to, strong opposition should be expressed by members of the community. \"Christians should be the ones to come forward to oppose wrongdoings in the Christian community, and Muslims should point out crimes committed by Muslims,\" he said. Hindus should address wrong practices within their community, the Thavanur MLA noted, adding that otherwise such interventions might be misinterpreted as attempts by other religions to degrade them. \"The majority of those caught in gold smuggling cases centered around Karipur International Airport (in Malappuram) are from the Muslim community,\" he said. \"Without addressing this, what reform and progress are those preaching love for Malappuram intending to bring to the Muslim community?\" Jaleel asked.

Soon after Jaleel put up the post, the IUML strongly criticised him, calling it \"extremely derogatory.\" \"What he said was that members of the Muslim community are carrying out smuggling. Where did he get this information? On what basis is he saying this?\" senior IUML leader P M A Salam asked. He wondered how a person could take such a stance, accusing an entire community of involvement in such a crime. Salam said that Jaleel might have many frustrations in life, but he should not have tarnished an entire community because of them. Jaleel courted fresh controversy at a time when Chief Minister Vijayan himself denied allegations of making any adverse remarks about Malappuram, the IUML leader added. Dissident MLA Anvar also came down on Jaleel over his comments, saying if the Thavanur MLA had indeed made such remarks, it was the \"worst thing\" in his public life. Earlier, the opposition Congress accused Vijayan of attempting to \"appease majority communalism\" through his recent interview, in which he was quoted as saying that gold smuggling and hawala cases were more prevalent in Malappuram district. The Chief Minister and his office subsequently denied making any such remarks in the interview. (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel )",

Bosnia sought EU help after a heavy rainstorm overnight on Friday left entire areas under water and debris destroyed roads and bridges, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens of others. Officials said at least 10 people are still unaccounted for, many of them in the village of Donja Jablanica in southern Bosnia, which was almost completely buried in rocks and rubble from a quarry on a hill above. Residents there have said they heard a thundering rumble and saw houses disappear before their eyes. Luigi Soreca, who heads the EU mission in Bosnia, said on social media site X that the EU stands with Bosnia and teams are arriving to help. Bosnia is a candidate country for membership of the 27-nation bloc. Authorities said Croatian rescuers have already arrived, while a team from Serbia is expected to be deployed on Sunday afternoon, followed by a Slovenian team with dogs. Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Czechia and Turkey have also offered help, a government statement said. Sunday is the date of a local election in Bosnia. Election authorities have postponed voting in flood-hit regions, but the flooding has overshadowed the vote across the country. Ismeta Bucalovic, a resident of Sarajevo, Bosnia’s capital, said: “We are all overwhelmed by these flooding events. We all think only about that.” Impoverished and ethnically divided, Bosnia has struggled to recover after the brutal war in 1992-95. The country is plagued by political bickering and corruption, stalling its EU bid.",

      "content": "An e-book reader device can be the best thing to have for anyone hooked on to reading. Making one from scratch can be an even more fulfilling experience, something that is perhaps more applicable to the DIY enthusiasts. One inherent benefit with such a device is that you have complete control over the entire thing, which includes the software side of it. With off-the-shelf e-readers such as the Kindle or the Kobo, you have a device that offers a very refined user experience but you are also tied to the company’s own content source. That can be a serious limitation but not so with a device that you have created on your own. Take for instance the one created by Guyrandy Jean-Gilles and is named Pi e-Reader. As mentioned by , the e-reader project is based on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) board and an E Ink display that has been manufactured by Good Display. The e-reader project also includes a touch interface as well as a front light system which will allow for comfortable reading even in the dark. The e-paper display communicates with the CM4 via the SPI connector while a Texas Instruments TPS61165 drives the front light. The brightness is controlled by the CM4 using PWM. All of the details have been hosted at , which includes the schematics, KiCAD files, and bills of materials for the CM4 version of the e-reader project. Also available for download is a Raspberry Pi HAT version to use alongside the full-sized SBC. Apart from the hardware itself, the software is another equally important aspect that ensures a refined user experience. Much of that again has been written by Jean-Gilles though other open-source codes and libraries have also been used. In its current form, Pi e-Reader comes with MuPDF for dealing with PDF files while eReader software has been sourced from The Open Book project. That said, it being a DIY project, you always the full liberty to customize and tweak the hardware and software to suit your specialized requirements. That said, what needs to be added is that the Pi e-Reader isn’t the simplest of DIY project and is best undertaken by those having some amount of hardware and software skills. With a keen interest in tech, I make it a point to keep myself updated on the latest developments in technology and gadgets. That includes smartphones or tablet devices but stretches to even AI and self-driven automobiles, the latter being my latest fad. Besides writing, I like watching videos, reading, listening to music, or experimenting with different recipes. The motion picture is another aspect that interests me a lot, and I'll likely make a film sometime in the future.",

Things get even better when Amazon is offering a nice deal on it, as it is at the moment when the . You get the Kindle Paperwhite e-reader along with a black fabric cover, and a power adapter as part of the bundle. This makes it the same price that a standalone Kindle Paperwhite sells for, which means you are getting the power adapter and the fabric cover practically free of cost. The price mentioned above applies to the Paperwhite model with 16 GB of storage. Also, there aren’t going to be any ads shown on the lock screen.

      "content": "The state government has issued an ordinance amending the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Act of 1955, granting legal sanctity and statutory powers to the Hyderabad Disaster Response and Assets Protection Agency (HYDRAA). The ordinance, promulgated by Governor Jishnu Vev Varma on October 3, was published in the Telangana Gazette on Saturday. Titled the \"Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2024,\" the legislation aims to empower GHMC commissioner to employ specialised agencies like HYDRAA to protect public assets such as roads, drains, streets, water bodies, parks, and open spaces. The ordinance outlines the necessity of these amendments to strengthen disaster response and safeguard public property. The key provision of the ordinance is the addition of Section 374-B to the GHMC Act, 1955, which empowers the state government to delegate authority to officers, agencies, or authorities to exercise the powers of the GHMC and its commissioner to protect public assets. This amendment specifically empowers HYDRAA to take action against illegal encroachments on public property and ensure asset protection as per the guidelines prescribed by the government. HYDRAA was originally established by the Congress government through Government Order (GO) 99 on July 19 under the Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MA&UD) department. Its primary responsibilities include reclaiming illegally occupied government lands, protecting Hyderabad's water bodies, and preventing urban disasters within the city’s Outer Ring Road (ORR) limits. However, the agency faced legal challenges, with certain individuals and political parties questioning its establishment in the High Court. The ordinance comes at a time when the Telangana government has been actively working to remove encroachments along the Musi riverbed, a move that has faced significant opposition from various quarters. The state government's swift action in issuing this Ordinance seeks to address these challenges and solidify HYDRAA's authority. A more comprehensive legislative framework for HYDRAA is expected to be introduced in the upcoming winter session of the Telangana Legislative Assembly.",

      "description": "Triumph Motorcycles may not be a well-known name in the U.S., but its bikes like the Triumph Speed 400 are high-quality and affordable cycles.",
      "content": "United Kingdom-based Triumph Motorcycles produces its bikes at factories in Asia and Brazil in addition to its facility in Hinckley, England. While the earliest Triumph Motorcycles were produced exclusively in the U.K., shifting production to other countries around the world enabled Triumph to keep motorcycle prices competitive as Japanese brands became more popular. As a testament to Triumph's cost-saving measures, the 2024 Triumph Speed 400, the cheapest of Triumph's \"Modern Classic\" lineup , carries an MSRP of just $4,995 . Don't let the low price of the Triumph Speed 400 or its smallish engine displacement steer you away from considering it for your first, or next, motorcycle. Motorcycle News' Carl Stevens says, \"the Triumph Speed 400 not only looks like a quality machine, ... it rides like one too.\" Triumph's 398cc single cylinder TR-Series engine , delivering 39.5 horsepower and 27.7 lb-ft of torque, lies at the heart of the Speed 400's tubular-steel perimeter frame chassis design. Exhaust exits out of a stainless-steel silencer, while power is transmitted through a six-speed manual transmission and X-ring chain final drive. The Triumph Speed 400 rider interface begins with a multi-function LCD screen incorporated alongside an analogue speedometer. Advanced rider controls include ABS braking front and rear and selectable traction control to complement the Speed 400's agile handling characteristics. With its 398cc single cylinder engine, you probably don't expect the Triumph Speed 400 to be among the fastest motorcycles ever built , but its top speed might surprise you. CycleNews reviewer Rennie Scaysbrook says the sub-400-pound Speed 400 topped out at 98 mph with their self-described ample physique aboard, while slimmer riders claimed to achieve 105 mph during a Spanish media launch. MotoSnax posted a video to YouTube showing the Triumph Speed 400 achieving 170 kph indicated by the speedometer, which supports previously mentioned rider claims of 105 mph. However, GPS indicated a lower top speed of 151 kph, or about 94 mph. Other videos on YouTube from Australianpilot , Bunny Punia , and BikerDaadLife show top speeds hovering around the 160 kph (99 mph) mark. The speedometer error reported by MotoSnax and the 160 kph top speed achieved by others are echoed by Charith Drive's YouTube video of the Triumph Speed 400 top speed test with a GPS indicated top speed reduced to around 143 kph or 89 mph. While the Triumph Speed 400 is fast enough to legally operate on any U.S. highway, it will likely leave your body vibrating after maintaining interstate speeds for more than a few minutes. It seems best suited for bopping around town, leisurely trips through the countryside, and spirited canyon carving jaunts close to home or transported to further destinations.",

      "content": "Sony's new PS5 Pro was made specifically for developers, offering them much more power and flexibility to upscale games and lead into the next-gen PS6. Capcom, like many others, are excited for what they can do with the PS5 Pro's new horsepower. The $700 PS5 Pro might have a high price tag, but it also has lots of potential for high-performance gaming. At least high er performance matched with solid 4K visuals, even if they are upscaled and not necessarily native. The real trick with the PS5 Pro is the console's new PlayStation Spectral Resolution AI library, on-chip machine learning/AI block, and beefier GPU. Developers can use the new tech to deliver higher frame rates, better visuals, and impressive RT effects--and sometimes, all three at once. Capcom is one such developer who's interested in pushing their games to new limits. The team is currently working on its new RE neXt games engine , and it's likely Capcom is forging its upgraded games-building environment to utilize new tech like the PS5 Pro. In a recent interview with IGN , Monster Hunter producer Ryozo Tsujimoto says his team is \"excited for the possibilities\" that the Pro will offer. \"We didn't think there was an option to just leave it on the table. We are getting great support from Sony in terms of helping us figure out what we're going to do with that,\" Tsujimoto said. \"So it's an extra thing to think about as part of the development process, but we're excited for the possibilities.\" That being said, there's no confirmation that Monster Hunter Wilds will support the PS5 Pro, at least at launch. In an interview with Dengenki Online , Tsujimoto said as much: However, other Capcom games like Dragon's Dogma 2 have been confirmed to support the PS5 Pro. Check the current list of compatible PS5 Pro enhanced games here .",

The live images of the device don't reveal anything new - circular camera island on the back, extremely thin bezels on the front and flat frame design all-around. Oppo Find X8 live images The leaked spec sheet, however, gives us some missing pieces of the puzzle. The vanilla Oppo Find X8 will feature a 6.5-inch BOE-made OLED panel and will run on a still-unannounced Dimensity 9400 SoC . The camera configuration on the back will consist of three 50MP cameras - main, ultrawide and a periscope telephoto unit with 3x optical zoom. The sensor used for the telephoto shooter is Sony LYT-600. A generous 5,700 mAh battery will keep the lights on, supporting 80W fast charging and 50W magnetic wireless fast charging. What's interesting, the specs mention an alert slider and a customizable virtual pressure-sensitive button. We may see something similar to Apple's Action Button and Camera Control all in one. Additionally, the device will feature IP68 or IP69 ingress protection, while the chassis will be just 7mm thick and weigh around 190 grams. Very impressive numbers. The available colors will be Black, White, Blue and Pink. Source",

      "content": "Java developers often seek ways to enhance productivity. The Groovy programming language offers a powerful solution, providing the flexibility Java sometimes lacks. While Java remains a robust programming tool, Apache Groovy complements it by simplifying syntax and increasing efficiency. Groovy is fully compatible with Java and runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Its seamless integration allows Java developers to introduce Groovy without learning a completely new system. Know how Java developers can leverage the Groovy programming language for efficient coding. By diving into Groovy fundamentals, developers can reduce boilerplate code and optimize their workflow. Java developers will appreciate how Groovy simplifies common programming tasks while enhancing overall development. The Groovy programming language is dynamic, concise, and designed to boost productivity. It integrates effortlessly with Java, making it an ideal tool for developers. One of Groovy’s key features is its dynamic typing, allowing developers to write shorter and more flexible code. Additionally, Groovy supports both dynamic and static typing, giving developers more control over their programming style. This versatility makes Groovy suitable for everything from quick scripting tasks to complex, large-scale projects. Apache Groovy is not just a standalone language; it enhances the Java ecosystem. Its ability to interoperate with existing Java libraries and frameworks is a significant advantage. Developers can leverage their Java knowledge while enjoying Groovy’s simplicity. Mastering Groovy fundamentals is essential for Java developers looking to streamline their coding. Groovy’s syntax is more straightforward than Java’s, eliminating the need for boilerplate code. For instance, Groovy allows developers to omit semicolons, reducing clutter and making the code easier to read. Another critical aspect of Groovy fundamentals is its closure feature. Closures are blocks of code that can be passed as arguments, which simplifies tasks such as sorting and filtering data. Java developers often find Groovy’s closure mechanism much more intuitive than Java’s equivalent. The Apache Groovy tutorial is an excellent resource for developers who want to learn more about closures and other essential features of Groovy. By working through the tutorial, developers will quickly grasp how to implement closures and other Groovy concepts in their projects. One of the biggest advantages of Groovy programming language is its concise syntax. Java developers often need to write a significant amount of code to perform even basic tasks. Groovy, on the other hand, simplifies this process. For example, developers can create lists, maps, and ranges with minimal code. Groovy also provides a range of built-in methods that make it easier to work with collections, strings, and other data types . This feature allows developers to write less code while achieving the same or even better functionality than in Java. A key component of Groovy fundamentals is learning to utilize these built-in methods effectively. The Apache Groovy tutorial offers practical examples that show how these methods work in real-world scenarios. The Groovy programming language is widely used for scripting and automation, thanks to its powerful scripting capabilities. Java developers can use Groovy to automate repetitive tasks, such as file handling, data processing , and interacting with web services. In addition, Groovy’s syntax makes it easy to write scripts that are both concise and maintainable. Whether you're working with databases, processing XML or JSON, or generating reports, Groovy simplifies the process. Developers looking to master Groovy scripting should consider exploring the Apache Groovy tutorial for in-depth guidance. Learning how to automate tasks with Groovy can lead to significant productivity gains. One of the best things about Apache Groovy is its seamless interoperability with Java, and because Groovy compiles directly to Java bytecode it's runnable in the JVM. Developers can thus mix Groovy with Java code without a care in the world. Groovy is also of great advantage because it allows the developer to make use of any Java code from Groovy or vice versa. Hence, you can make use of libraries and frameworks in Java while including the short syntax Groovy has on offer. Java developers who want to enhance their projects without completely switching languages will find Groovy a perfect fit. The Groovy programming language offers the best of both worlds: the power of Java with the simplicity of Groovy. Groovy language is the tool every Java developer should understand, since its short syntax, dynamic type, and convenience of integration with Java mean a lot in increasing productivity. So, the master of Groovy fundamentals and an Apache Groovy tutorial enables a developer to significantly improve their coding experience. Groovy facilitates smooth day-to-day programming, especially about working with collections or automating processes. The best thing about Groovy is that it helps a Java developer introduce it to his project without disturbing any of the existing code. Using Apache Groovy will make a Java developer write less, cleaner code, both more straightforward and efficient.",

First, a group of four passengers arriving from Dubai attempted to hide 12 iPhone 16 Pro Max units by wrapping them in tissue paper. Later that day, another passenger arriving from Hong Kong to the same airport attempted to smuggle 26 iPhone 16 Pro Max models in her vanity bag. Had all of the smuggling been successful, the amount of tax the government would have lost out on would have been around $14,000. That's because the cost difference between the iPhones in other countries versus the retail Indian price can be over $500 more than the US base price. For comparison, a base iPhone 16 Pro Max sells for $1,199 in the US, while in India the base price translates to $1,724, or 144,900 rupee. Customs@IGI Airport seized 12 iPhone 16 Pro Max from a group of four passengers trying to smuggle these iPhones from Dubai by indigo flight 6E-1464 on 01.10.2024 pic.twitter.com/V1FeY9ez0I — Delhi Customs (Airport & General) (@AirportGenCus) October 3, 2024 The price difference is chiefly because India places a high import tax on certain devices, such as iPhones. The aim is to encourage companies to manufacture devices within the country, which was originally one reason why Apple began making iPhones in India for local sale . Apple is now increasingly manufacturing iPhones in the country, but the majority are for export and so are not subject to the tax. In November 2023, though, the Indian government began an investigation that could yet see Apple facing a $600 million levy related to its accounting practices over the local subsidiary buying iPhones for local resale. All 38 iPhones were seized by customs officials. It's not known whether the smugglers will be charged, nor how these 38 on the same day compare to previous levels of smuggling into the country.",

      "content": "Justice S. Nanda of the Telangana High Court ruled that the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, is a beneficial piece of legislation that has been enacted by the Parliament, specifically meant for the welfare of the working class. This social security measure is a humane homage the state pays under Articles 39 and 41 of the Constitution. The viability of the fund depends on the employer duly deducting the worker's contribution from their wages, adding his own share, and promptly depositing the sum into the fund constituted by the Act. The mechanics of the system will suffer paralysis if the employer fails to perform his function. The dynamics of this beneficial statute derive their locomotive power from the funds regularly flowing into the statutory bill. The proper implementation of various schemes under the Act is solely dependent upon the prompt compliance by the establishment. The petitioner filed an appeal under the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, before the appellate authority. However, he failed to deposit the statutory amount and sought a waiver of the same. The industrial tribunal rejected the plea for a 75 per cent waiver, stating that the impugned order pertains to 2017 and the matter has been stayed for the last five years. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, no case is made out for a complete waiver of 75 per cent of the pre-deposit condition. In the interest of justice, the appeal was admitted on the remittance of 30 per cent of the determined amount under section 7-A within six weeks from the date of passing the order. Upon compliance with the said condition, the operation of the impugned order was stayed, and the appeal was admitted for consideration and hearing. Aggrieved by the said order, the school filed the present writ petition, stating, among other things, that important documents, the inquiry report, and salary register copies were not furnished to the petitioner, despite specific requests. The petitioner further claimed that no reasons were assigned as to how the dues, amounting to about Rs 12 lakh, had been determined. Rejecting the plea of the petitioner, Justice Nanda pointed out that this court is of the firm opinion that, as per section 7.0 of the Act, 1952, 75 per cent of the amount determined should be deposited for the admission of the appeal under section 7-I of the Act. However, the tribunal was considerate to the petitioner-school and ordered the school to remit 30% of the determined amount under Section 7-A within six weeks from the date of passing the order. The judge further held that the reduction of the pre-deposit amount to 30 per cent is not illegal, and since there is no breach of any fundamental right of the petitioner, this court is of the firm opinion that when the appeal is still pending adjudication by the competent court (tribunal) as stipulated under law, this court cannot entertain a writ petition on the same subject under Article 226 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the petition was dismissed. A two-judge panel of the Telangana High Court took on file a writ plea of an aspiring doctor seeking admission under the quota prescribed for persons with disabilities. Maryam Rasheed Hussain filed a writ petition aggrieved by the action of the Kaloji Narayana Rao University in rejecting the case of the petitioner on medical grounds. The petitioner, who appeared for the NEET examination successfully, pointed out that the competent medical authority had certified the petitioner as one with 77 per cent handicapped and was therefore eligible for being considered in the quota prescribed. However, the university rejected the case of the petitioner stating inter alia that the petitioner suffered a higher degree of disability and that the medical council regulations did not permit a person of such nature to undergo the degree course. The panel voiced the idea of referring the matter to an independent board but posted the matter to October 14 for the university to respond. Justice Pulla Karthik of the Telangana High Court took on file a writ plea challenging the actions of the Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC) in not regularizing the services of its housekeeping staff, supervisor and labour class. The judge dealt with a writ plea filed by D . Somalingan and seven others, alleging that non-regularization in category-IV of employment was illegal, arbitrary and in violation of the Constitution. The petitioners also alleged that the same was contrary to the settled position of law laid down by the Supreme Court in catena of judgements. The standing counsel, appearing for the union, argued that the writ petition was not maintainable as service-related disputes pertaining to the respondent falls within the jurisdiction of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). The standing counsel also pointed out that the Department of Atomic Energy was notified under the Administrative Tribunals Act and therefore, no remedy could be granted by the High Court. Reference was also made to the previous order passed by the single judge of the court deciding the issue of jurisdiction vis-à-vis service disputes pertaining to the respondent. On request of the petitioners for withdrawal of the writ plea, the judge proceeded to dismiss the writ plea granting liberty to the petitioners to pursue remedies by approaching the appropriate legal forum.",

      "description": "The captain declared a mayday over the Hudson Bay and diverted to Chicago.",
      "content": "Passengers onboard a recent United Airlines flight between Los Angeles and London Heathrow were unexpectedly diverted to Chicago O'Hare on September 26. AvHerald reported that the captain's displays went blank as the flight management computers entered a degraded mode. Turned back over the Hudson Bay UA231 departed Los Angeles International Airport on Thursday, September 26, at 13:37, almost an hour behind its scheduled departure time of 12:55. The flight rose to its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet and quickly headed northeast towards Canada and, eventually, Europe. However, as it passed over Manitoba and Hudson Bay, the captain's primary flight and navigation displays entered a degraded mode. Given the conditions and flying with limited capabilities, the captain declared a mayday and diverted to Chicago O'Hare, United Airlines HQ, where the carrier has extensive maintenance facilities. A look at the subtle but distinct difference between \"pan-pan\" and \"mayday\" and how they are used. Flight data and schedules were sourced in this article from Flightradar24 UA231 diverted to Chicago Using alternative navigation tools and vectors, the captain and the rest of the crew on the flight deck were able to navigate back to Chicago, passing over Ontario, Lake Superior, Michigan, and Wisconsin before landing at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), landing at 21:51 local time. Affected passengers were rebooked onto a replacement aircraft, which departed from Chicago at 01:24 on the morning of September 27, arriving at London Heathrow Airport at 15:02 later that day. The replacement service was operated by N13013 (serial number 40931), a Boeing 787-10 that joined the United fleet in March 2020. The return flight for the aircraft was then subsequently delayed, seeing N13013 operating as UA263 from London to Denver, Colorado. Departing at 17:08 instead of 14:50, but making up time en route to arrive in Colorado just 75 minutes behind schedule at 18:50 (vs 17:35). Have you heard the Simple Flying podcast recently? Nine-year-old N27958 The aircraft that experienced the technical issues was a United Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner with registration N27958 (serial number 36406) that can accommodate up to 271 passengers onboard. Having joined the fleet in September 2015, the nine-year-old aircraft is frequently deployed on some of the airline's most iconic routes. After the incident, N27958 remained on the apron at ORD for two days to thoroughly review its systems and returned to service on September 28, operating as UA845 to Sao Paulo . This most recent United Airlines incident came just days before the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed its intentions to drop a safety probe into the Star Alliance carrier. This follows a string of safety incidents, including a United 737 MAX that saw its landing gear collapse on the runway at Houston on March 8. Despite the incident occurring over Hudson Bay, the FAA confirmed that it was not continuing an investigation with the carrier and reiterated that it found no significant safety issues . The aircraft appears to have taxied into the grass while leaving the runway.",

      "content": "Revenue Minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy reiterated on Saturday that the proposed revenue system, following amendments to the existing one, would serve as a model for the country. The Revenue Act, 2020 and the Dharani portal, introduced by the BRS government, had caused problems for people, particularly in land transactions, he said. It is to overcome this that the government will introduce the new system, Srinivas Reddy told farmers during a meeting in Nellikal of Tirumalgiri (Sagar) mandal. To address the Dharani issues, officials had studied the revenue systems of other states and gathered public opinions to evolve an effective new mechanism. He also revealed that Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy would attend a public meeting in the Nagarjunasagar Assembly constituency on December 9, where 4,000 acres of land will be distributed to the landless poor. Former minister and senior Congress leader K. Jana Reddy suggested that officials from the revenue and forest departments conduct a joint survey and issue pattas to farmers cultivating forest lands under the RoFR Act or 1/70 Act. Nagarjunasagar MLA Kunduru Jayaveer Reddy, Miryalaguda MLA K. Laxma Reddy, and MLC C. Koti Reddy also attended the programme. Srinivas Reddy noted that land issues primarily affect farmers who occupy land but do not have pattadar passbooks, as well as those who have pattas but no land. These problems will be resolved after the state government completes its land survey, he added. The minister announced that 3,500 Indiramma houses would be sanctioned for each Assembly constituency by the end of October. He promised 5,000 houses for the Nagarjunasagar Assembly constituency, including 1,500 additional houses. He instructed district collector C. Narayana Reddy to ensure that previously sanctioned Indiramma houses for the poor are released from mortgage and handed over to the beneficiaries.",

      "description": "The official line from the White House confirmed that Biden had signed the bill into law sans any other commentary. But the implications are pretty clear: this opens the door for a speedier build-out of cutting-edge chip plants across the nation.Read Entire Article",
      "content": "What just happened? President Joe Biden put his signature on a bill this week that will allow semiconductor manufacturing projects funded by the CHIPS Act to skirt certain environmental regulations. The new law exempts them from lengthy environmental impact reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), greasing the wheels for these major construction projects to get off the ground faster. The official line from the White House confirmed that Biden had signed the bill into law sans any other commentary. But the implications are pretty clear: this opens the door for a speedier build-out of cutting-edge chip plants across the nation. For new semiconductor fabs to be exempt, they are required to meet one of three conditions: The project kicks off construction by December 31, 2024; the federal funding comes in the form of a loan/loan guarantee; or said funding accounts for no more than 10% of the total project cost. In essence, these new fabs have a narrow window to start construction this year and can only accept federal loans up to a certain threshold to qualify for the NEPA exemption. How that plays out in practice remains to be seen. Still, proponents of the bill argue that it will enable rapid expansion of semiconductor production alongside industries like renewable energy. However, critics have cried foul, saying it muzzles communities' ability to scrutinize environmental and health hazards – things like toxic chemical leaks – that often accompany such heavy industry. A coalition of green groups had urged Biden to veto the bill, highlighting risks from substances like PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl) that don't break down and have been linked to various cancers. As the Sierra Club's legislative affairs lead Harry Manin put it in a written statement, \"This bill would remove the last remaining federal lever to assess the impact of massive semiconductor fabs on drinking water, air quality, climate change, and community health.\" Despite the pushback, the bill sailed through the Senate late last year, though it met stronger resistance in the House, passing with a 257-125 vote amid opposition from top Democrats who questioned exempting fabs from environmental checks. Backers, however, tout the necessity of ramping up semiconductor production as a matter of technological and economic competitiveness, especially after the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act set aside serious funds for revamping the domestic chip industry. Just like the Act, the bill comes as a result of the economic and national security issues caused by the death of US semiconductor manufacturing, which has almost entirely moved to other countries over the past few decades.",

      "content": "A Delta Air Lines Airbus A330-300 aircraft was involved in an incident at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS) after takeoff while on its way to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) as flight DL161. The aircraft was operating a regularly scheduled flight but was forced to return to the Dutch capital due to a landing gear issue. The incident According to a report by AvHerald , the incident occurred on October 2, 2024. The A330 was climbing out of the Dutch airport when the crew was forced to abort the climb due to an issue with the landing gear. Per the report, the crew was unable to retract the landing gear and decided to return to Amsterdam. Inevitably, having the landing gear out throughout the whole flight has several consequences, not least the drag this would cause on the plane, increasing overall fuel consumption. Flightradar24 data shows that the A330 circulated over the North Sea, parallel to the Dutch coastline, before returning to AMS. It landed and passengers supposedly disembarked to allow for a technical inspection of the plane. The issue was seemingly resolved in AMS, though, as the aircraft returned to service on a regularly scheduled flight to Detroit (DTW) on October 5. Per flightradar24 data, it does not seem as though a replacement aircraft was sent to take the stranded passengers to Amsterdam. Together with joint venture partner KLM (also flag carrier of The Netherlands), passengers were likely rebooked onto later flights US-bound. Air and ground crews must work together to formulate a plan. The aircraft The plane in question is registered N819NW. According to ch-aviation data, the example was with Northwest Airlines before coming under Delta Air Lines ownership after the merger agreement in the late 2000s. It is 17 years old and was delivered to the company in September 2007. It is pictured below in 2015. It is configured with 282 seats, distributed across three classes as follows: 203 in economy class (and 24 in economy plus) 21 in premium economy 34 in business class Get all the latest aviation news right here on Simple Flying At the time of publishing, the aircraft is finishing up the transatlantic leg of its flight from AMS to DTW, with Flightradar24 schedules indicating that its next flight is the return leg to the Dutch capital. It will then fly a return trip to MSP. A similar incident in 2020 In December 2020, another Delta Airbus A330 faced a similar issue related to landing gear retraction , forcing it to return to Amsterdam Schiphol. The aircraft was operating to Atlanta, but on takeoff, the flight crew could not retract the gear. The aircraft entered a holding pattern over the North Sea before heading to Amsterdam and landing overweight. The difference in that case was, however, that the plane took off for Atlanta without issue approximately two hours later.",

The cycling season is not far from its conclusion but the first half of October packs in some treats right at the end, among them Paris-Tours. First raced in 1896, this is one of cycling's oldest races, its name carrying a certain prestige that comes with its decades of history. The organisers have sought to spark renewed interest with a shake-up of the route in recent years, controversially throwing in gravel tracks in the vineyards around Tours. What was often a sprinter's race now sees 10km of gravel and eight short climbs in an action-packed final 75km. The start list, therefore, features a number of riders suited to the traditional Spring Classics, as well as the more robust sprinters. Former world champion Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) will be a formidable force, while the Belgian duo of Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Arnaud De Lie (Lotto Dstny) also enjoy favourite status.

      "content": ": Reviewing the preparedness of the official machinery in tackling the North East monsoon that is likely to bring rains to the State in a week or two, Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin ordered the authorities to take precautionary measures on a war footing and ensure that the lapses of the previous year were not repeated. Chairing the meeting, attended by key Ministers and top officials, at the Secretariat on Saturday, Udhayanidhi Stalin stressed on the strengthening of the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) by providing relevant data on details like spots prone to water stagnation, location of relief centres, and the availability of pump sets to drain out water, boats and other appliances like tree cutters. Referring to some mistakes made during the relief operations in the previous year, the Deputy Chief Minister said that kitchens should be set up close to places that were prone to water stagnation with a view to reaching food to people without delay. He also insisted on keeping at least 1000 milk sachets and 100 loaves of bread in every ward. Aavin officials should be instructed to supply milk sachets to Corporation councilors, MLAs and officials when they approached them and also ensure that there was no hitch in transporting milk sachets from the production centres in Ambattur, Madhavaram and Kakkalur in Chennai, as it happened last year when the milk could not be reached to the flood affected people, he said. Urging the electricity board officials to raise the level of the junction boxes before the monsoon sets in and to use generators to provide electricity to the streets when power supply was cut due to water stagnation, he said marooned areas should be supplied water through tankers. Since mobile phones were down, victims could not access help last year during the rains, the Deputy Chief Minister recommended the provision of wireless sets to Ministers, MLAs and officials coordinating the rescue and relief operations. Insisting on the officials completing the work taken on clearing the storm water drains, desilting the water bodies, laying electricity cables, laying water supply pipelines and removing water hyacinth before the rains, he said no new work should be taken up without completing the ongoing work. He told the Ministers and officials to rope people with a desire to mitigate the suffering of people in the rescue and relief operations and suggested the forming of WhatsApp groups in every ward with the MLA, officials, local body representatives, youth and volunteers to respond to the disaster demands quickly. People living in dilapidated urban dwellings and in areas like the old tsunami housing colonies should be warned of the possible dangers and even evacuated to safer places and appliances like tree cutters should be kept ready across the vulnerable parts of the city and not in one place, he said. Though the DMK government had managed many disasters including floods and the Coronavirus, this time there should be more planning in advance like keeping relief equipments and accessories like tree cutters, boats, and motor pumps spread out across the vulnerable areas and not in one place from where they would be taken of affected spots after the disaster..",

      "content": "Old habits die hard. At times, for politicians, old associations have a way of coming to the fore as was the case with the BJP floor leader in the Telangana Assembly A. Maheshwar Reddy. An active leader in the Congress until a couple of years ago, Maheshwar Reddy was at the BJP’s Rythu Deeksha he organised and led in Hyderabad this past week. Several top state BJP leaders joined him, as did AbhayaPatil, the BJP’s organisation in-charge for Telangana. During his speech, Maheshwar Reddy mistakenly called Patil the AICC in-charge for the state, and was about to continue with his speech when it was pointed out that Patil is not from Congress but the BJP and that the slip of the tongue needs correction. He did, but not before many in the gathering noticed the slip. In yet another twist to the strained relationship between senior IAS officer Arvind Kumar and the Congress government in Telangana, the special chief secretary found himself in the spotlight once more — this time, following a social media post. Known for his allegiance to the previous BRS regime, Arvind’s recent post on X has sent ripples through the Congress corridors with the controversy erupting soon after the Centre released flood relief assistance on October 1 to 14 states. While NDA-ruled Andhra Pradesh received `1,036 crore and poll-bound Maharashtra bagged the highest `1,492 crore, Telangana was given a mere `416 crore in stark contrast to the Congress government’s request for over `10,000 crore. Congress leaders were quick to express outrage, accusing the Centre of blatant discrimination. Even as this indignation peaked, Arvind, in a return to social media after a nine-month hiatus, posted on X that Telangana can expect more funds in the days ahead, and that the `416 crore was merely an “immediate” assistance. More funds will follow based on the final report submitted to the Centre, he said. The post struck a discordant note amid the political finger-pointing, leaving the ruling party embarrassed, with some Congress leaders reportedly questioning the bureaucrat’s loyalty. In a city where Metro Rail trains run like clockwork (mostly), it seems the man behind the scenes, N.V.S. Reddy, might soon be stepping off his 17-year-long ride as managing director of Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL). Appointed way back in 2007 by then Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy in undivided Andhra Pradesh, NVS has managed to hold on to his seat through political storms, state bifurcation, and different CMs, changes that you will need both hands to count. But it looks like the Congress government headed by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy is ready to apply the brakes on NVS, for long mastering the art of clinging to his post. Revanth Reddy is gunning for an ambitious Metro Rail expansion project and whispers in the corridors of powers say that NVS’s decade-and-a-half of survival instincts might not be enough to meet the CM’s vision for a “war footing” approach. Rumour has it that three technocrats — including a contender from the South Central Railway—are being considered to take over the steering wheel at the HMRL and press the accelerator. Recall the popular childhood game of cops and... you know how that goes. But, in the real world, things are different and it is more of a game of cops and politicians with clearly drawn lines between the two getting blurred real fast. Take the case of the Nizamabad police commissionerate. Recently, the city’s top cop Kalmeshwer Shinganevar decided to effect the transfer of inspectors, well within the limits of rights and rules enjoyed by the official. But then came the other side. Not all leaders in the Congress were reportedly happy with the proposed changes and the transfers were in limbo for a while, and dropped. The game has surely changed from the one children play in which the cops always win. There seems to be more than what meets the eye in the recent outburst of Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy against veteran Congress leader and former MP K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao. The Chief Minister openly accused his party colleague of conspiring with the BRS leadership to create unrest in Hyderabad by instigating people living on the Musi riverbed. A little bird says that Revanth Reddy’s grouse against KVP, who once wielded enormous power thanks to his sole qualification of proximity to Dr Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, is not new. As it was an open secret that KVP enjoyed good relations with BRS supremo K. Chandrashekar Rao during the latter’s 10-year rule, Revanth Reddy is believed to have voiced his suspicions on KVP with the party high command in the run-up for 2023 Assembly polls. Post change of guard, insiders say, KVP has emerged as a father figure for the anti-Revanth Reddy camp and CM’s grouse is that the rival’s activities were not confined to dissidence within but have now gone beyond. The penchant to court controversy seems to be never dying for C.V. Adithya Praveen, CEO of Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board. The juniors are humiliated by the babu who openly abuses them using unprintable language, and extends these “courtesies” even to those on Ayyappa Deeksha, and calls them fraudsters. He was in the news earlier for humiliating his colleague, the visually-challenged K. Simhachalam, and not offering a chair to then MLA V. Rajeshwari, forcing her to sit on the floor along with her supporters. The officer again hit the headlines when he was moved out of poll duty following complaints of bias towards YSR Congress and the complainant was none other than Dy CM Pawan Kalyan. And now, the official’s rude behaviour has drawn the attention of the CMO, if the word doing the rounds in the bureaucratic corridors is anything to go by. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu who kicked off a huge storm with revelations on tainted ghee used in the making of the famous Tirupati laddus, received much-needed support from ally and state BJP president D. Purandeswari amidst the continuing back and forth over the laddus issue, with the Supreme Court saying religion should be kept out of politics and the YSRC latching on and saying that Naidu was all along targeting its leader Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for political gain using the issue. The SC’s remarks on Naidu arrived not too long after the court pulled up Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy over his comments on the judiciary, particularly orders from the court. Though the Revanth Reddy issue is still fresh, it apparently did not make any difference to Purandeswari, who said that Naidu, as the Chief Minister and constitutional head, had the prerogative to make a statement on the issue after holding a review with the officials and the court’s responsibility was to see whether the government decisions were being implemented properly or not. Her comments followed the Supreme Court, in the Tirupati laddus case, saying a person holding a high constitutional function should be careful on what he or she says, especially when an inquiry is already underway. For good measure, she added that people should think on how far the courts can go on what the Chief Minister can or cannot say. Good luck is hard to come by, but for the people of Pithapuram — who elected Jana Sena supremo Pawan Kalyan, who went on to become AP’s Deputy Chief Minister — a jackpot has certainly arrived. With him becoming the No. 2 in the government, authorities have been holding a grievance redressal day every Monday in Pithapuram. With the district collector Shan Mohan making it clear that Pithapuram is a VIP constituency and grievances received must be attended to immediately, people in the constituency have started believing that good times are coming for them finally.",

      "content": "Google is rolling out a new set of features aimed at making it less easy for thieves to access your data. That’s according to Mishaal Rahman, who that the features are showing up in a new update after seeing that his Xiaomi 14T Pro phone now has Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock, two of three features Google . Others say they only see the third one, called Remote Lock. The flashiest of is Theft Detection Lock, which uses AI to lock your screen when it detects “common motion associated with theft,” like someone snatching your phone out of your hand. Meanwhile, Offline Device Lock locks a device’s screen when it’s offline for a while, and Remote Lock lets users lock their phone using only their phone number when they can’t log into Find My Device with their password. So far, I’m not seeing any of the features on my own Pixel 6. You can see screenshots of the new features’ settings in the overnight Threads post from Rahman below. Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock are supported on any Android device running Android 10 and up, while you’ll need at least Android 5 for Remote Lock. If you don’t have the features yet, you can try updating Google Play Services, though Google tends to roll out new features over time, rather than to everyone at once, so, like me, you may have to wait. /",

      "description": "NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service has a lot to offer, including films, TV shows, sports, news, and more. But is Peacock right for you?",
      "content": "When it comes to choosing one of the best streaming services for entertainment, there are plenty of great options out there, and among the best is Peacock. Peacock is NBCUniversal’s answer for what to watch next, and it houses thousands of hours of film and TV, with a mix of older favorites and new original programs. First released in 2020, it is aimed at competingwith Netflix , Hulu, Amazon, Paramount Plus , and other streaming giants. Peacock has made a splash since its launch, with 34 million subscribers as of 2024. Its easy to understand why, too, with competitive prices, a library with more than 80,000 hours of content, and access to tons of live sports events. There is plenty here to love, and even leaving the service is a breeze, should you so desire. However, before you decide whether to subscribe to Peacock, we’re here to help you evaluate if it’s the right choice for you. How much is Peacock? Peacock Premium is now the lowest tier, as the free option is no longer available. Even with Peacock Premium, you still have to watch ads. Still, for a nominal fee of $8 per month, you can access a vast library of content, including movies, TV shows, live sports (including Premier League soccer), Telemundo Spanish-language series, and more. If you want to enjoy the same content without ads, you can opt for the second tier, Peacock Premium Plus , which costs $14 monthly. The difference between the two tiers is that with Peacock Premium Plus, ads are mostly eliminated, except for some events (such as sports) that may have ads due to preexisting agreements. Peacock Premium and Peacock Premium Plus are discounted if you pay yearly and are currently $80 and $140, respectively. There are also student offers. Over the years, some cellular companies have offered special tie-ins with Peacock that tend to lower the per-year price. These change often, so check with your provider before subscribing to Peacock. What do you need to watch Peacock? Peacock can be accessed through various platforms . A web browser is a good starting point. Peacock is compatible with popular Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari browsers. It can also be accessed on Android and Apple iPhones and iPads. PlayStation and Xbox users can find Peacock on their consoles. Peacock works with select smart TVs, including Samsung, Vizio, LG, and Hisense. Peacock is also available on Apple TV , Roku, Amazon, Google TV , and Chromecast . It can be accessed through select cable box sets from Cox, Spectrum, and Xfinity. Moreover, it’s available through Meta VR for the Meta Quest and Meta Quest Pro. Which movies are included on Peacock? One advantage of having the Universal Film Library at its disposal is that Peacock has a great movie selection and some classic titles right out of the gate. There’s also a selection of films from other studios. However, the titles of films available are always changing. Among the most popular films on Peacock are Trolls Band Together, Dunkirk, The Dark Knight, Split, and this year’s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Oppenheimer . Which TV shows are on Peacock? Peacock excels when it comes to television. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Peacock has several of the best TV series ever. That includes 30 Rock, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Battlestar Galactica (2004) , Cheers, Columbo, Everybody Hates Chris, Everybody Loves Raymond, Friday Night Lights, Knight Rider, Leave It to Beaver, Magnum PI, Miami Vice, Monk, Murder She Wrote, Parks and Recreation, Psych, The Munsters, and , The Rockford Files . Current NBC series are also among the Peacock lineup , including Quantum Leap, Law and Order, Law and Order: Law and Order: SVU, Law & Order Organized Crime, Night Court , and the three Chicago-based shows Chicago Fire, Chicago Med, and Chicago P.D. Paramount Network’s hit series Yellowstone also has a home on Peacock. If you love late-night comedy, Peacock is also where you can find new and classic episodes of Saturday Night Live , The To night Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and Late Night with Seth Meyers . What original series are on Peacock? The Peacock streaming service is expanding its collection of original shows across genres such as comedy, drama, reality, and documentary. Some popular titles generating buzz are Apples Never Fall, Ted, The Traitors, Love Island USA, Vanderpump Rules, Poker Face, Dr. Death, The McBee Dynasty, Deal or No Deal Island , and many others. What original films are available on Peacock? The Peacock original movies library has expanded slightly with titles such as Megamind, Dr. Death, Joe vs. Carole , and Angelyne . It also includes full-length feature documentaries like Stormy, Pathological, John Carpenter’s Suburban Screams , and more. What about sports? It’s no surprise that Peacock programming strongly focuses on sports thanks to its partnership with NBC Sports and Telemundo Deportes. The platform offers a variety of live and streaming content throughout the year, including the Olympics, National Football League, soccer, college football and basketball, golf, cycling, boxing, and more. Some of this programming is exclusive to Peacock. The service also offers WWE content. What are Peacock channels? Peacock Channels is a unique feature of the Peacock streaming service. These channels offer live and on-demand content across three main categories: news, sports, and entertainment. To date, there are over 50 channels to choose from. Does Peacock include 4K streaming? Peacock provides a limited selection of 4K content to its Premium and Premium Plus subscribers. However, the 4K library is relatively small and can only be streamed on specific platforms. You can identify the available 4K content by looking for the 4K UHD badge in the Information section of the content. What are Peacock’s optimum internet speeds? According to Peacock, a minimum internet speed of 3 Mbps is sufficient to enjoy Peacock’s services without any interruptions. However, to enjoy high-quality live events and ultra-high definition premium content, it is recommended that your Wi-Fi or 4G/5G/LTE speed should be at least 8 Mbps. You might not know your internet speed off the cuff, so you can test it here . How do you get Peacock? To access Peacock , you can start by visiting its website. However, to subscribe to Peacock Premium or Peacock Premium Plus, you must provide your credit card details. Unfortunately, no free trial is available, but you can cancel your subscription anytime. See the above “What do you need to watch Peacock?” section for all the platforms and devices on which the service is available. You can find the Peacock app in your respective channel store and download it to your device.",

      "content": "Foraging pangolins already dig in the dirt, so why not get them planting trees while they're at it? Well, training them would be pretty hard, which is why a California high school student named Dorothy designed a pangolin-inspired to do the digging and planting. Dubbed the Plantolin, the bio-inspired bot is the latest winner of the annual Natural Robotics Contest, which is run by the University of Surrey and funded by the British Ecological Society. In a nutshell, the competition invites people from all over the world to submit their ideas for nature-inspired robots that are capable of doing something to help the planet. The winning concept gets made into an actual functioning prototype by one or more of the partnering research institutes. In the case of the Plantolin, that partner was the University of Surrey itself. Other partners include Queen Mary University of London, the Royal College of Art, EPFL Lausanne (Switzerland), the Technical University of Munich, and Alexander Humboldt University (Germany). The previous winner was a that filters microplastic particles out of the water. In the same way that a pangolin waddles on its two hind legs, the Plantolin balances Segway-style on two wheels. Each wheel is powered by an electric quadcopter drone motor. The long tail is raised as a counterweight when the robot is making its way across the ground, but tilts down to provide leverage once the bot stops to start digging. That digging is done by two motorized front legs. Those legs have claws that stay locked in place when they're scooping soil away, but passively bend back out of the way when being drawn forward to take another scoop. Once the hole has been dug, the Plantolin drives over it, pooping a yew tree \"seed bomb\" (basically a nugget of seeds and soil) the hole as it does so. Those bombs are fed into a dispenser through a hole in the top of the robot, and are carried by an internal conveyor belt to its \"butt\" for dispersal. \"The restoration of forests through planting more trees is essential for the sustainable development of our planet,\" says Dorothy. \"Pangolins spend a lot of their time digging in the ground, so I thought a planter robot inspired by the pangolin's behaviour would be very natural.\" The Plantolin was built by University of Surrey roboticist Dr. Robert Siddall, who explains more about the bot's workings in the video below.

      "description": "\"There is a decision being made now as to whether to stop making pure ICE for the U.S. market,\" the company's chief scientist said.",
      "content": "Even Toyota Knows The End Of Internal Combustion Is Near \"There is a decision being made now as to whether to stop making pure ICE for the U.S. market,\" the company's chief scientist said. Every company, whether it makes gadgets or home entertainment or software, wants its own technology to win. But it also has to go where the market is going. I'd say that's even tougher in the automotive world these days as global regulations push car companies toward a zero-emission future . The world's largest automaker by production and sales volume, Toyota , gets this too. And even as it's been behind the curve on purely electric vehicles, its success with hybrids has it plotting the end of pure internal combustion. Toyota's chief scientist admitted the company is discussing the end date for its non-electrified cars in America, he told Bloomberg this week. “In the U.S., there is a decision being made now—and I’m not a part of it—as to whether to stop making pure ICE for the U.S. market,” Gill Pratt, Toyota’s chief scientist, told the outlet in an interview. “Just the fact that we’re thinking of that means that, OK, it must be close.” That may come as a surprise to anyone who's passionate about Toyota's (admittedly very good) internal combustion engines, like the rowdy little three-cylinder in the GR Corolla or the almost-the-last-of-its-kind naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 in the Lexus IS 500 F Sport. But if you pay attention to Toyota's sales, you might realize this is the way things have been going for a while. Toyota's track record with EVs hasn't been all that great. Its three electric offerings in the U.S. (if we count the related Subaru Solterra as well) are pretty outclassed in range, charging time and overall tech by competitors from the U.S., South Korea and Europe—to say nothing of the Chinese automakers that are leading the way. Gallery: Toyota Next-Gen EV Production Line But those electric models are still selling quite well , and especially, so are Toyota's hybrid models. Toyota pioneered hybrid tech and now has the biggest lineup of electrified cars of any automaker. In September, nearly half of its U.S. sales were EVs or hybrids. It's moved the ubiquitous Camry to an all-hybrid setup , meaning one of the few four-door sedans to still sell in any meaningful volume in America is now an electrified car. For Toyota, that's the future. Not purely ICE vehicles. Company officials have hinted at times that the eventual plan is an all-hybrid-or-electric future in America, but this is one of the clearest admissions yet as to where things are going. Pratt has been with Toyota for almost a decade now and is also the CEO of the Toyota Research Institute. Before that, he held leadership roles at the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and MIT. This is all to say that he's a smart guy and when he talks about climate matters, he knows what he's talking about. In that Bloomberg interview, he admits to being “thoroughly depressed” by the growing amount of CO2 emissions driven by human activity. “If you’re not scared by this curve, then you’re not seeing it right,” he said. At the same time, Pratt has been a vocal proponent of Toyota's own skeptical approach to pure electrification as the future of cars. The automaker has instead argued for a \"multi-pathway\" approach with many different automotive powertrains depending on customer needs, whether those are hybrids, hydrogen vehicles or pure EVs. (It's also worth noting that, again, any company wants its technology to win. And two out of those three things have been driven by Toyota itself.) There are two ways to look at that approach. The more critical one is that hydrogen power for passenger cars really isn't panning out so far and that hybrid vehicles, while much cleaner and more fuel-efficient than pure ICE ones, still generate carbon emissions, unlike EVs. But the other, perhaps more pragmatic way to look at it is that anything that takes pure ICE off the road is progress and that it's easier to get people into hybrids—for now, anyway—than it is to shift the entire market in a fully electric direction. Just this past week, Toyota said it would join other automakers in pushing back EV production in the U.S. amid concerns over uneven demand . “What I’m trying to emphasize in my talks now is please, please, please, we all want the same thing, but let’s stop the wishful thinking,” Pratt said in that interview. “Let’s think about what really is going to occur, what human nature is like, what politics is like, the capital that folks don’t have to change their cars, and let’s find a way that accepts the reality of all those things, and let’s change what we actually can change.” But I would say that no matter how you want to think of the evolution of car technology, the world's biggest automaker admitting that pure ICE has some kind of end date is a very big deal. In the near future, every Toyota for sale in the U.S. could be a hybrid, an EV or perhaps a hydrogen car. And that speaks volumes about where everything is going.

      "content": "Thanks to increased visibility or interest, there are now more high-quality accessories for the Google Pixel 9 series than ever before. We’ve been testing the devices for a while, and here are some of our favorites that we think you might want to try. Google Pixel 9 initial review: Almost impossible to hate From power banks to protection, there are tons of decent accessories to pair with a Pixel 9, 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL. One of the best things this year is that regular Pixel 9 and 9 Pro accessories are fully cross-compatible too. BACKBONE One Mobile Gaming Controller (Playstation Edition) The Backbone One for Playstation is a game-changer for those who prefer physical controls. Its familiar button layout and comfortable grip transform your Pixel 9 Pro into a handheld console. One the best aspects is that this has an official PlayStation aesthetic, and the pass-through charging feature is a huge plus. It’s a perfect companion because there is no need for extra batteries or cables to overburden you. If you’re worried about latency, there practically is none. We’ve been testing for a long time, and it’s perfect for all types of gameplay, whether you’re playing a fast-paced shooter or emulating classic games. While it might feel a bit small for larger hands after an extended period, it’s a massive upgrade from touch controls, especially if you can find it on sale. Get the BackBone One controller Mous Pixel 9 case Thin, high-quality, protective Pixel 9 accessories and cases are few and far between. Pitaka makes some solid aramid fiber thin protection, but Mous has the best MagSafe-capable slim protection that almost feels like an official offering. Soft inlay to protect your phone from scuffs and scrapes, super precise cutouts for buttons, the charge port, and a soft lip for the camera bar. The addition of MagSafe means you can add in other accessories usually made for the iPhone series. Sure, the price is high—almost $60—but you’re getting the best thin protective cover for your Pixel 9 and lots of epic colors to choose from. Get a Mous case for Pixel 9 JIC AirGuard MagSafe case This budget-friendly MagSafe case offers excellent value at around $24. Its slim design and vibrant green color beautifully complement the Pixel 9 Pro. The sturdy TPU rubber with a textured finish provides a secure grip, while the clear back showcases the phone’s design. The surprisingly strong magnets ensure a reliable connection with other MagSafe accessories, making it a great way to expand the types of accessories you can use with your Pixel. One of the biggest reasons that a good MagSafe-compatible case feels like a must this year. Get the JIC AirGuard case for Pixel 9 Spigen Ultra Hybrid The Spigen Ultra Hybrid case with the digital camo pattern is a cool little case that’s both stylish and protective. It’s got a clear back so you can show off your phone’s color, and the camo design is totally unique. It’s pretty thin for a case, but it still keeps your phone safe. If you’re looking for a good case that won’t break the bank, this one’s a winner. Get the Spigen Ultra Hybrid case for Pixel 9 X-level faux leather case The X-level Faux Leather case offers a sophisticated look for the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro but without breaking the bank. Its minimalist design and raised camera lip provide excellent protection without adding bulk. The precise cutouts ensure easy access to all ports and buttons. While the branding is a bit prominent, it’s overall a great value for a premium leather-like case. There is only one concern with faux leather and PU leather products – how they will age. If you prefer “real” leather products, you might want to look elsewhere. It does have MagSafe, though, which is another boon. Get the X-Level faul leather case for Pixel 9 Anker MagGo USB-C SD card adapter If you pickup a case with MagSafe connectivity, you owe it to yourself to at least consider the Anker MagGo USB-C SD card adapter. There are a few things to bear in mind with this super cool optional Pixel 9 accessory. It lets you save files to external full-size SD and microSD cards. Where it’s most useful is for video recording when using third-party apps like the Blackmagic Camera you can shoot video directly to an SD card. This means you don’t need to clog up your precious on-device storage to shoot at high-resolution, but it also makes it easier to edit on your PC or Mac with a super simple transfer method. You can quickly switch out storage, and it sticks neatly to the back of your phone case, provided it has MagSafe. The USB-C cable tucks away inside of the removable lid, while you can even charge if you want to shoot video and keep hooked up to external power too. Get the Anker MagGo USB-C SD card adapter Anker 321 MagGo battery The Anker 321 MagGo Portable Wireless Charger is one of those perfect accessories because not only is it compact, it offers a convenient and affordable solution for keeping your Pixel 9 series powered up each day. Magnetic power banks aren’t exactly new, but we love this one because of the 5000mAh capacity and slim design. It’s easy to carry, throw in a pocket or bag, or even leave somewhere convenient. The 7.5W output provides ample power for a full charge in about 1.5 hours. While the white version may be prone to scratches, it’s a great value at $25. When paired with a compatible MagSafe case like the JIC Airguard, it’s a perfect Pixel 9 accessory for on-the-go charging. Get the Anker 321 MagGo battery for Pixel 9 ChargeASAP Flash Pro Plus 100W USB-C charging, a wireless charging pad, 3 USB-C ports, a single USB-A port, and 25,000mAh capacity in one super-premium package. That is the crux of the ChargeASAP Flash Pro Plus. I have been carrying this as my power bank of choice for the better part of 6 months. The LED screen gives you full feedback on the charge rates of each port, the temperature of the power bank itself, and its capacity and power draw. You can fully charge a Pixel 9 Pro XL five times, which makes it one of the best companions if you’re going off-grid for a few days. This is not a cheap accessory, and we don’t recommend it as a standalone phone accessory. However, if you want a long-lasting power bank that can charge your laptop, phone, watch, tablet, and other accessories, few are better. Get the ChargeASAP Flash Pro Plus Ugreen 45W PD charger A good charger is worth its weight in gold at times. Especially if you have multiple devices. The official 45W Google charger is fine; it’s just a bit limited. This is why I’ve been using a dual-port Ugreen USB-C charger that is rated at 40W – but there are slightly newer, faster versions available. It’s also worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro XL only supports wired charging at a real-world 32.7W in our testing, so you have plenty of overhead with a 40W charger for the fastest speeds. If you have multiple devices the charger limits speeds on each port, but this isn’t that much of a problem if you want to top-up something like the Pixel Watch 3 and your Pixel 9 at the same time. The GaN tech means better power efficiency and less heat generation, while the foldable design means it’ll fit in a pocket if you need to take it with you too. Get a dual-port Ugreen 45W charger PopSocket Adding some extra grip to your phone is often as easy as slapping a case on, but sometimes you want a little added utility. A PopSocket costs under $10 and you can stick it on a case or directly to the back of your phone to add something to clasp hold of. For people with smaller hands, having something to reach for and dual purpose might come in handy. I’m less convinced when using a PopSocket as a kickstand, but if you place it well at the back of your phone, it can be used as such. The best thing is that you can just remove it if it isn’t for you. Get a PopSocket Spigen screen protector I’ll admit that Spigen screen protectors are a little pricey. However, the installation process is super simple and practically foolproof that it makes the increased cost worth it in my opinion. The Glas.tr protection is super precise once you follow the 30-second fitting process. You should be able to use the in-display fingerprint scanner without re-registering, but doing this means it’ll work more consistently. The feeling of the screen protector isn’t as smooth as the real glass underneath, but it’s high-quality and your finger shouldn’t snag or feel rough patches like some super cheap screen protectors suffer with. The protection is also excellent due to the edge-to-edge coverage. With a case fitted, there’s little of your phone exposed or at risk when dropping.

      "content": "This powerful platform provides: Scalable and secure notebook environments Real-time collaboration and feedback Accessible data analysis and visualization tools Perfect for research institutions, educators, and data science teams, JupyterHub streamlines workflows and accelerates innovation. Learn more about JupyterHub's key features and benefits in our article. Link is in our bio. Data science has grown rapidly in the last decade, transforming industries by enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions. As data science teams continue to expand in size and scope, effective collaboration has become essential for success. Managing large datasets, collaborating across different teams, and ensuring reproducibility in code can be challenging without the right tools. Fortunately, there are several collaboration platforms designed specifically for data science teams. Among the most notable is JupyterHub, a powerful tool for collaborative data science work. But beyond JupyterHub, a suite of other tools and platforms, also support collaborative workflows, making it easier for teams to work together efficiently. This article explores JupyterHub and other top collaboration tools, showing how they enable seamless data science teamwork in 2024 and beyond. JupyterHub is an open-source, multi-user version of the Jupyter Notebook, one of the most widely used tools in data science. Jupyter Notebooks allow data scientists to combine code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text into a single, shareable document. It has become an essential tool in the data science community because of its simplicity and versatility. However, when teams grow, individual Jupyter Notebooks may not be enough. This is where JupyterHub comes in. JupyterHub allows multiple users to work in the same server environment, enabling collaboration on a larger scale. It provides each user with their own Jupyter Notebook , eliminating the need to set up local environments for every team member. Users can access their Jupyter notebooks from any browser, which simplifies collaboration, especially for remote teams. ● Multi-User Environment : JupyterHub enables multiple users to work on the same infrastructure, allowing seamless collaboration between team members. Each user gets their own notebook server, which runs in the same environment, so there are no discrepancies in code execution across different machines. ● Scalability : JupyterHub can be deployed on a single server or a cloud-based infrastructure, making it scalable for small teams or larger enterprises. Cloud-based deployment on services like AWS or Google Cloud allows data science teams to scale up resources when needed, managing large datasets and complex computations efficiently. ● Customizable Environment: JupyterHub can be tailored to meet specific project requirements. Data science teams can install necessary libraries, integrate external tools, and provide access to shared data sources for all users. This flexibility is vital for teams working on diverse datasets and projects. ● Reproducibility : A major advantage of using JupyterHub is that all team members work in the same environment, ensuring that any code written and executed is reproducible. This eliminates the problem of “it works on my machine” and makes debugging more efficient. While JupyterHub is a fantastic tool, it's not the only option for collaboration in data science. Several other platforms complement or offer alternatives to JupyterHub, helping data science teams manage their workflows, share insights, and maintain efficient collaboration. Google Colab Google Colab gained popularity for its free access to cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks. It’s a great alternative to JupyterHub for smaller teams or independent data scientists. Colab allows users to write and execute Python code in the browser with no setup required, making it ideal for rapid prototyping or collaborative experimentation. One of the key advantages of Google Colab is its access to free GPUs and TPUs, which are highly beneficial for running complex machine learning models. Collaboration is simple, with Google Docs-style sharing features, making it easy for team members to work on notebooks simultaneously. Kaggle Kernels Kaggle owned by Google, is widely known for its data science competitions and datasets. However, it also offers Kaggle Kernels, which are free cloud-based environments for running Jupyter Notebooks. Kaggle Kernels provide an environment pre-configured with many popular data science libraries, making it easy to start working on projects quickly. Kaggle also has a large community of data scientists, making collaboration even more accessible. Teams can share their notebooks publicly or privately, receive feedback, and build on others’ work. While Kaggle is mainly geared toward competitions and individual learning, its collaborative tools make it a good option for teams looking for a simple, cloud-based platform. GitHub and GitHub Codespaces GitHub is the standard platform for version control and collaborative coding, and it has become a cornerstone for data science teams as well. By using GitHub, teams can collaborate on code, track changes, manage branches, and ensure version control, all of which are critical in data science projects that involve multiple contributors. For more dynamic collaboration, GitHub Codespaces allows users to create fully customizable cloud-based development. Data science teams can set up a common environment in Codespaces, ensuring everyone works with the same tools and configurations without needing complex local setups. Dask Distributed Dask Distributed , it is for teams working with very large datasets or performing heavy computations, Daskis an excellent tool. Dask is a parallel computing library that integrates seamlessly with Jupyter and Pandas. It allows data scientists to scale their computations across multiple machines while maintaining the simplicity of Python. Dask Distributed is the multi-user, scalable version of Dask. It can be used in conjunction with JupyterHub to distribute computation-heavy tasks across a cluster. This ideally allows large data science teams to deal with massive datasets and complex models. Apache Zeppelin Apache Zeppelin is an open-source, web-based notebook that supports interactive data analytics. Similar to Jupyter, it supports multiple languages such as Python, Scala, and SQL. Zeppelin is especially useful for teams working with big data ecosystems like Apache Spark and Hadoop, as it offers powerful integration with these technologies. Whereas standout feature of Zeppelin is its multi-user collaboration support allowing several team members to work on the same notebook in real-time. This makes it an attractive alternative for data science teams focusing on big data and real-time analytics. As data science teams grow and projects become more complex, effective collaboration tools are essential for success. While JupyterHub remains a leading choice for managing multi-user environments, platforms like Google Colab, Kaggle Kernels, GitHub, Dask Distributed, and Apache Zeppelin provide unique features that cater to different team needs. By leveraging the strengths of these tools, data science teams can boost collaboration, streamline workflows, and enhance productivity, ensuring that they are well-equipped to tackle the challenges of 2024 and beyond.",

      "content": "The EXPO is the latest clever home contraption from they company behind some of the around: a modular smart case solution that will see your collections displayed in glorious technicolor. If you are one of those people who collect things (I am one of those people) you will inevitably end up with more things than places to put them. Shelves are fine, but you’ll need to dust every week (I am not one of those people), and the situation can get really out of hand if you ever move house, as most of your collections remain in the attic for months/years while you figure out where it is all going to go. Nanoleaf comes to the rescue with its attractive modular smart illuminated display case system. Nanoleaf collaborated with US company Meeni Inc on its Fantaqi product, which is sold by Nanoleaf as the Nanoleaf x Fantaqi EXPO. What this collaboration has produced is one of those rare things that is both eye-catching and useful, even if only to collectors and smart home nerds. Each case measures 38 x 29 x 22cm (W x D x H), but you’ll want to shave off roughly 3cm to account for the thickness of the walls. To give you some idea of its scale, a DVD case will stand perfectly inside, but will need to be inserted at a slight angle to get past the lip on the front of the box. I must admit to initially being skeptical about these boxy smart lights, but once I saw them in my house brimming with some of my favorite collectibles and objet d’art, I was sold. As with the iPad and the , I just didn’t 'get it' until I got one. I’ve enjoyed liberating my stored collections and being reminded of why I collected all this stuff in the first place. These are a quick and easy solution to my storage problem. Yes, they are expensive and the petulant software drives me nuts, but alternative Perspex display cases are not cheap and the EXPO’s modular design allows you to try them out in different places easily. Add to that their smart capabilities; totally worth it. The Nanoleaf x Fantaqi EXPO launched in August 2024 and is , or . There are two accessories for the EXPO if you need more of the inter-case connectors or are expanding to a stack of more than 8 cases. The 75W power supply can power up to 14 cases. Display case pricing Accessory pricing Aesthetically, the Nanoleaf EXPO isn’t much to write home about; each white display cube is simply designed. The real magic begins when you flick the switch to light up your life. The system has been designed so that only the top case containing the LEDs and back panel (which has the connector slots) is 'live'. As long as you follow the provided assembly diagram you should find it easy enough to connect properly. The rest of the cases are simply push-fit, but they do require a bit of force, so I would recommend that they are assembled on a non-slip surface. I worked along all of the seams with my thumbs just to make sure the seams were seated properly. Each case has four feet, which fit into the recessed top of the case below to provide some vertical stability. Each case is electrically connected to the next one using the supplied linker strips which slot into holes midway along the sides of each case. It can be a bit tricky to get the Linker in the hole when coupling two cases but it’s a minor irritant. I was not convinced of the stability of the Nanoleaf Expo when configured in an 8-box vertical stack, but once loaded with your collectible contents, the whole thing became more and more stable. However, it might not survive the onslaught of a small child, but why would you let them near something so precious? Are you mad? Each case has slots running up the sides to provide a channel for the power supply lead. A slight constriction somewhere along the channel to hold the lead in place would have been nice, but it is possible to put the lead under a bit of tension by curling it under the back of the bottom-most box of the stack. Fortunately, the power lead is 2.5 meters long which gives you the option of placing them on a shelf, and as each case weighs in at around 2kg, the shelving need not be industrial strength like mine. I was initially puzzled by the clear back panel until I switched them on and noticed it effectively creates a pleasing halo on the wall around the stack. I also love the magnetic front door latch, as all too often fixtures like interference-fit door latches can make a whole unit wobble wildly when you open a door, or there’s some form of mechanical push-in opener that invariably fails over time. The stack does still move a little when you open a door but all is forgiven when it closes with such a resounding ‘thunk’ noise. Yes, I am one of those people who enjoy the rich sound of a high-quality car door closing. My only gripe is with the power supply plug. It’s quite attractive and it’s very cool that it has three different snap-in plug converters, but the three-pin one is upside down. Look, Nanoleaf, most of us have so many electrical appliances that we need to use electrical extension plugboards; a lot of them. We cannot lay them flush against the wall if someone has decided to provide a plug with a lump on top with the power lead coming out of it. It makes even less sense when plugged directly into the wall, as all the weight is above the socket. Having reviewed several Nanoleaf products in the past, I knew that reaching the point at which you can power the hardware up is usually the easy bit. In comparison, while the universe descends cyclically from order to chaos over billions of years, the Nanoleaf app will give you a sneak preview of that chaos in just a few hours. After six wasted hours of crashes and bugs (including the infamous 'Accessory already in another home' message from HomeKit) I decided to give up on the EXPO for the day. I am sure it will come to pass that it will start working but it’s frustrating that Nanoleaf specifies features that initially do not work. There is better news for the rhythm source feature of the Nanoleaf desktop application on Mac; it now works as it should, much to my delight. The Mac app still crashes regularly though. I love this product and I want Nanoleaf to continue coming up with original, if somewhat niche, products, but I do hope the company begins to do a little more software quality assurance before products launch and not after. I am willing to accept that some of my problems may be PICNIC problems (problems in customer not in computer), but not the majority of them. What troubles me is that people will stop buying Nanoleaf products if they have the same experience. Buy it if Don't buy it if As was the case when I reviewed the , there isn’t an equivalent product for the Nanoleaf x Fantaqi EXPO that I am aware of. However, if you want to create a DIY system using smart LED strip lights instead. there are a few options available. I ensured that my test environment was up to date and working with the latest versions of firmware and software for all devices before even unpacking the Nanoleaf x Fantaqi EXPO. I visually checked the status of Apple Homekit every time the application crashed and visually checked the status of the application itself on restart and investigated any anomalies. I investigated the phone application automation options and tried out the various in-app features and functionalities. I’ve been using smart home devices for several years now, and have a whopping 30+ years (gulp) of tech enthusiasm and experience under my belt.",

      "description": "BJP remains hopeful of win",
      "content": "Most of the exit polls predicted that the Congress-NC alliance has an advantage in the assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir but the BJP remained hopeful of forming the government in the Union territory.National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah, however, described the exit polls as 'just time pass' even though the results are in favour of his party. \"I'm amazed channels are bothering with exit polls especially after the fiasco of the recent general elections. I'm ignoring all the noise on channels, social media, WhatsApp etc. because the only numbers that matter will be revealed on the 8th of Oct. The rest is just time pass,\" Abdullah, a former chief minister, wrote on X. Several exit polls gave an edge to the NC-Congress alliance and predicted that the regional party could emerge as the single-largest party in J&K. Reacting to the exit poll predictions, J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina said his party contested the assembly polls with all its strength. \"We are confident that BJP will emerge as the single largest party when the results are out on October 8,\" he said. Raina said the BJP leadership that included Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda campaigned for the party and got tremendous support from the people. \"BJP will emerge victorious on October 8 and will start working on the formation of the government. We fought the elections on our own strength. Our target is to win the elections with the blessings of the people and we will achieve splendid victory,\" he said. J&K Congress president Tair Hameed Karra said the Congress-NC alliance is in a comfortable position to form the next government in the Union territory. \"This election was primarily to keep the BJP out of the power corridors, restoration of statehood along with land and job guarantees. I am seeing the (Congress-NC) alliance in a comfortable position to form the government,\" Karra said. He said the mandate of the people is formation of the government against \"divisive forces and hatemongers\". \"People voted for redressal of their genuine grievances as they suffered a lot over the past 10 years with the top echelons of power both in the Raj Bhavan and Civil Secretariat working like kings. The BJP needs to explain to the people what they have done in the past 10 years,\" Karra said. He said the BJP has no moral right to accuse the NC and Congress of reviving terrorism and said, \"Everyone knows that terrorism shifted from Kashmir to the peaceful Jammu region. Only the goal post has changed in the past 10 years.\" People's Democratic Party (PDP) said the exit polls were not reliable and it was too premature to talk about government formation. \"We have seen that exit polls are not reliable. What matters are the numbers that will come at the end of counting,\" senior PDP leader Naeem Akhtar told PTI. Asked if the PDP will support the NC-Congress coalition if need be, Akhtar said it was premature to comment on that. \"They might not even need our support. Finally, a decision on this matter will be taken by the party. All said and done, we are still part of the INDIA bloc. We have not gone anywhere,\" he added. The C-Voter-India Today survey predicted 40-48 seats for the NC-Congress alliance and put the BJP at 27-32 seats in the 90-member J&K assembly. Dainik Bhaskar pegged the NC-Congress alliance at 35-40 and the BJP at 20-25. Peoples' Pulse saw the NC-Congress alliance with 46-50 seats as against the BJP's 23-27, while Republic-Gulistan put the the NC-Congress tally lower at 31-36 as against the BJP's 28-30. In different polls, the PDP was seen winning between 5 and 12 seats, while other candidates were also seen bagging 4-16 seats. The results of the assembly elections will be announced on October 8.",

      "content": "Riding on the heels of yesterday’s announcement that Samsung’s One UI 7 has been delayed until early 2025 comes a bit of news that makes the wait more bearable. Samsung is getting a redesigned camera app in One UI 7 that should make it dramatically more convenient to take photos using only one hand. Android Authority shared a YouTube video and broke down the findings in it, but it’s worth watching the clip on your own. It’s just over six minutes long and provides a lot of information about the new interface. User SamMobile posted a video detailing his hands-on experience with One UI 7. Around the five minute mark, he goes into specifics and shows off the new camera app, highlighting several noteworthy changes. The biggest change is that viewfinder settings have been moved to the bottom of the screen for easier access when operating the camera with only one hand. It’s now available as a carousel, making it easier to scroll through all of the various options without trying to do Simone Biles-worthy stretches with your hand. In other words, you can now turn flash on and off, change the aspect ratio, and much more without diving deep into menus. The app will also display the relevant settings automatically depending on the camera mode you have selected. We first saw these changes a while back in leaked screenshots, but the images weren’t clear. This video shows a much closer look at the app. Keep in mind that Samsung hasn’t yet announced the One UI 7.0 Beta, so the final version of the app might change by the time it releases sometime next year. Either way, with everything this new interface brings to the table , it’s worth getting excited about.",

      "description": "Semiconductor industry sources recently told the Taiwan-based Commercial Times that TSMC plans to charge over $30,000 for wafers built on its upcoming 2nm N2 process node. The move would continue the price increases that have escalated for a decade.Read Entire Article",
      "content": "The big picture: As TSMC and other semiconductor manufacturers prepare to transition toward bleeding-edge 2nm transistors, more reports regarding the Taiwanese giant's plans have emerged. Although unconfirmed, claims of higher prices would align with prior analysis and the company's trends from recent years. Semiconductor industry sources recently told the Taiwan-based Commercial Times that TSMC plans to charge over $30,000 for wafers built on its upcoming 2nm N2 process node. The move would continue the price increases that have escalated for a decade. The reason behind the hike is unsurprising. Manufacturing 2nm semiconductors is expected to be more complex and precise than the 3nm wafers that currently represent the cutting edge. The rising costs account for software, manpower, and increased reliance on expensive EUV lithography. However, an AI-assisted design process is expected to soften the blow. If the reports prove accurate, they would support last year's analysis from consulting firm IBS. The group estimated that building a 2nm semiconductor manufacturing plant that produces 50,000 wafers per month would cost around $28 billion. That's about $8 billion more than a 3nm fab. Furthermore, the estimated per-wafer cost presents a 50 percent increase over 3nm and a doubling over 4 or 5nm. Although prices will vary among TSMC's clients, they have come a long way from 2014's roughly $3,000 28nm transistors. In response to the trend, some have noted that, in some respects, the cost per transistor has stagnated since 28nm, effectively freezing the cost aspect of Moore's Law and driving the prices of advanced computer chips upwards. With nanosheet gate-all-around transistors and other innovations, N2 promises a 25-to-30 percent reduction in power consumption compared to 3nm, a 10-to-15 percent performance boost, and roughly 15 percent more transistor density. TSMC plans to begin mass-producing N2 in the second half of 2025. Apple has reportedly claimed all of TSMC's initial 2nm supply, which is expected to power the iPhone 17 Pro. Samsung, Intel, and Japanese firm Rapidus have similar semiconductor manufacturing plans but are unlikely to exert market pressure on TSMC. Samsung is seeing yields below 20 percent, putting the company far behind TSMC. Meanwhile, Intel recently canceled its 20A (2nm) node – originally planned for this year – and will introduce an 18A process next year instead. The company will also use transistors from competitor TSMC for its latest generation of CPUs. Rapidus, collaborating with IBM, aims to introduce its 2nm process next year but won't begin mass production before 2027.",

      "description": "The Hellcat may be the quintessential modern muscle car, but there are plenty of faster models out there, many of which come from surprising brand names.",
      "content": "From 2015 to the present day, one car has risen above them all to become the de facto ultimate American muscle car, and the only one to still carry that torch to the present day: the Hellcat. In truth, the Hellcat moniker has appeared on several vehicles, and the powertrain has powered various other models under the Stellantis roof (perhaps a few too many). Still, Hellcat is a word that enthusiasts associate with the ultimate muscle car. While the Camaro and the Mustang were too busy becoming all-out sports cars, the Hellcat remained true to its muscle car roots, with a big powerful, supercharged V8 engine, RWD, and handling that inspires fear, rather than confidence. Throw in lots of wheelspin and a curb weight that would embarrass city buses, and you have the ultimate recipe for the quintessential muscle car of the past decade. The Hellcat started with 707 hp back in 2015, and by the end of the run, Dodge managed to squeeze over 1,000 hp from it. However, while the Hellcat's performance is very impressive, it's time to face reality: There are other cars that simply do it better. After decades of gatekeeping its entire RS lineup from North American buyers, and then teasing them a little bit with the RS3, Audi returned with a vengeance at the beginning of the 2020s with the RS6 Avant. The latest generation of Audi's long-running midsize performance sedan is, in a lot of ways and for a lot of people, the only car that needs to exist. Thanks to AWD and chassis engineering of the German variety, the RS6 Avant can easily outrun a Hellcat, despite having way less power. The regular RS6 Avant and its 591 hp V8 can reach 60 mph in just over 3 seconds, beating the original Hellcat by more than half a second. Meanwhile, the RS6 Avant performance (in all-lowercase) and its 621 hp can reach 60 mph in around 3.3 seconds, which bests not only the original Hellcat, but also the 797 hp Hellcat Redeye. That's pretty impressive already, but it gets better. The RS6 Avant is, at the end of the day, also a station wagon. There's plenty of room for five people on-board, and you can fit your and your entire family's closet in the cargo area. What's more, the RS6 Avant's platform isn't two decades old, which means much more modern components, better technology, and a whole other level of build quality. It's more expensive, but you get what you pay for. It's okay if you don't remember this entry-level McLaren from a decade ago — you wouldn't be the only one. Back in 2015, McLaren decided to introduce a model to directly compete with stuff like the Porsche 911. The 570S sat below the 650S and eventually the 720S in the lineup. While it had other variants that are even less remembered, the 570S was the most common one. Powered by the new and improved 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8, the 570S made 570 hp. Because it's also RWD, you might think there's no way it can be faster than the Hellcat or Hellcat Redeye, which have 137 and 227 extra horsepower, respectively. Nope, the 570S gives the Hellcat a roundhouse kick, thanks in part to launch control, and, you know, way less weight. McLaren claims the 570S can rocket to 60 mph in just 3.1 seconds, which is over half a second faster than the Hellcat. The 570S also wins the top speed battle, topping out at 204 mph. Assuming the reliability issues are sorted, the 570S is actually a brilliant supercar that is definitely worth a canter through the used market. The F12berlinetta marked the end of an era back in 2013: It was the last front-engined V12 Ferrari to be designed by Pininfarina. Ferrari's in-house design team penned the replacement, the 812 Superfast. The F12berlinetta was the replacement for the 599 GTB, and back then it was the ultimate expression of what Ferrari was all about. A gorgeous exterior where beauty and aerodynamic functionality were in perfect harmony, a screaming 720 hp V12 under the hood, RWD, and a dual-clutch automatic transmission. This one isn't just faster than a Hellcat, it's also a little more powerful than the original 707 hp version of the muscle car. But how much faster is it actually? Given the right circumstances, the F12 can reach 60 mph in 3 seconds or less. It'll also sail way past the Hellcat flat out, with a top speed of 211 mph. Similar to the 570S, the F12berlinetta has lost a fair bit of value over the past decade, and it's worth considering if you need to scratch that V12 Ferrari itch. The original Ford GT was launched back in 2005, though it debuted a couple years prior to celebrate Ford's 100th birthday. While it was a serious supercar, it took a more old school approach, and it was definitely made using what Ford had. You could also say the same of the second generation GT, but it was a completely different animal altogether. Ford's second generation GT laughs in the face of old school performance, with incredible aerodynamic achievements like the flying buttresses. People were quick to snub the original GT due to having \"only a V6,\" but this was anything but a normal V6. Sure, you could get a similar 3.5-liter unit in an F-150, but in the GT it was all about performance. A lofty 617 hp combined with extraterrestrial aerodynamics propelled the second-gen GT to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds. Remember, it was still RWD. With a top speed of 216 mph, it would also leave the Hellcat completely trailing in its wake flat out. That's not even the whole story, as the GT went out to prove that it can run rings around just about anything at the race track, Hellcat or otherwise. After an entire decade of a brilliant V10 symphony, Lamborghini has called it quits on the Huracan. The replacement for the Gallardo arrived in 2014, using a fettled version of the same 5.2-liter V10 engine. From 2014 to today, there've been about 63 different versions of the Huracan, each more powerful and capable than the last. Basically every Huracan is faster than a Hellcat in almost every aspect. The 5.2-liter V10 in the original made 602 hp, an improvement over the Gallardo's 562. Thanks to AWD and a super quick dual-clutch transmission that replaced the controversial E-Gear, 0-60 mph in the Huracan is in the high 2 second range. That means that even the original Huracan is almost a full second faster than the Hellcat in basically all its forms. The Huracan is also an absolute thrill ride, and while it doesn't have any of the tire squealing, no-traction tomfoolery that the Hellcat offers, it's a Lambo, so it's pretty much guaranteed to put a smile on your face regardless. Especially if it's a hopped up model. It seems Chevy wasn't content with going after only sports cars when it switched the Corvette to a mid-engine layout back in 2019, as its now going after the world's supercars as well. The Z06 is for the track fiends, but there's also now a totally new way to have a 'Vette: the E-Ray. The Corvette E-Ray represents two major firsts for the nameplate: It's the first factory Corvette to come with AWD, and it's also the first one with an electrified powertrain. The standard 6.2-liter V8 from the regular Stingray remains, but a small electric motor at the front axle joins in for a total system output of 655 hp. Crazy to think that you can now buy a Corvette with the same power output as the original Koenigsegg CC8S. With all four wheels driven and with such a power figure, the Corvette E-Ray completes the 0-60 mph sprint in less than 3 seconds, actually closer to 2.5 seconds. You may lose the supercharger noises, but you certainly don't lose the classic American V8 noises. The wider body on the E-Ray, shared with the Z06, is also a class act. In fact, during our first drive of the E-Ray we found the whole car is a class act. After years and years of western audiences asking for it, Nissan finally introduced global markets to Godzilla with the R35 GT-R in 2007. It dropped the Skyline moniker reserved for the Japanese market, but make no mistake: The GT-R is part of the same family. Back in the day, the GT-R was often considered a supercar killer, despite only using a twin-turbo V6 and having a lot less power. The original R35 GT-R had somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 hp, while the most recent one had a pretty meaty 565 hp. Thanks to AWD and the fabled launch control system, it's quite easy to get an R35 to 60 mph in the high 2 second range, which easily bests just about every Hellcat model. For as much as the GT-R has evolved over the years , this model is definitely showing its age. However, while the competition has managed to catch up, it shouldn't take away from achievement that was the R35 GT-R. While it is faster than a Hellcat, the CT5-V Blackwing is also very close to the Hellcat, in some ways. The Blackwing name was first used on the CT6 luxury sedan and its fascinating twin-turbo V8. Sadly, GM fumbled that whole idea, and began to just use the Blackwing name on its most powerful performance sedans, without the shared engine design. The CT5-V Blackwing is the king of the hill in the V lineup, and it comes with a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 developing a monstrous 668 hp. All of that goes to the rear wheels, by the way, and you can have either a 10-speed automatic or a standard-fit six-speed manual. The V8 in the CT5-V Blackwing is actually quite similar to that of the Corvette C8's powertrain, continuing the tradition of Cadillac V sedans using Corvette power. Compared to the regular Challenger Hellcat, the CT5-V Blackwing bests its 0-60 time by two tenths of a second, taking 3.4 seconds to achieve the speed according to Cadillac. Despite their similarities, the CT5-V is faster, and also more luxurious, more comfortable, more modern, and more practical. Plus, again, you can go and buy one right now. Hot hatchbacks have gotten so fast nowadays, we should start calling them fire-hazard hatchbacks — that is certainly the case with the latest Audi RS3. Despite even more crackdowns on emissions, Audi insists on keeping the five-cylinder engine in the RS3, making it the only current production car to have one. And what an engine it is. The latest RS3's power and performance is ridiculous, excessive even for a hot hatchback. As part of a recent facelift, Audi introduced the RS3 performance, which squeezes 401 hp from the 2.5-liter TFSI. 401 hp, people, in a hot hatchback. That's more than the original Aston Martin V8 Vantage, in a car that shares most of its underpinnings with the VW Golf. Thanks to Quattro AWD, the RS3 makes mincemeat of the Hellcat in the sprint to the magical 60 mph, taking just 3.3 seconds compared to the Hellcat's almost pedestrian by comparison 3.7 seconds. Being a compact car, the RS3's dimensions are also not a nuisance, and the smaller size and lighter weight figure also means much more agility. The first generation Mercedes-AMG GT was a classic interpretation of the front-engine, RWD sports car. A big V8 in the front, RWD, and a gorgeous exterior to wrap it all up in. The latest second generation version of the AMG GT is much of the same, but now, Mercedes wants to make it a more serious performance car. In top-of-the-line GT 63 guise, the AMG GT packs 577 hp from its 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8. That figure is similar to the previous AMG GT R, except now, the GT 63 comes standard with AWD. Mercedes also recently revealed the GT Pro, which offers up 604 hp from the same powertrain. The GT 63, according to Mercedes-AMG, can reach 60 mph in just 3.1 seconds. That makes it more than half a second faster than a Hellcat. Along with the oodles of power and speed, the AMG GT also has style on its side once again. It's a very attractive sports car, retaining the overall shape of the previous generation, while also being more modern and more in check with Mercedes' current design language. We can all agree that it's more luxurious and modern than a Hellcat on the inside, as well.",

      "description": "Disney+ may be the home of Pixar and Marvel, but it also streams other, more adult fare. This great prequel is one such movie, and is great to watch in October.",
      "content": "When it first launched, the Disney+ movie catalog included a strange assortment of titles. There were all of the animated classics, as well as plenty of Star Wars and Marvel content, but unlike streamers like Netflix and Max, the assortment of titles didn’t seem to be quite as random, or really offer something for everyone. Thankfully, in the years since, the streamer has diversified the kinds of titles available thanks to its Hulu integration, and now, you can catch all kinds of genres on the streamer. If you’re looking for one movie to watch this October, though, you should watch The First Omen . This horror prequel is the perfect Halloween pick, and it will also leave you riveted. Here are three reasons you should check it out. We also have guides to the best movies on Netflix , the best movies on Hulu , the best movies on Amazon Prime Video , the best movies on Max , and the best movies on Disney+ . It’s the best kind of prequel The First Omen is ostensibly a prequel to The Omen , and it does check many of the boxes of a typical prequel. If you’re watching the movie and have never seen The Omen , though, you don’t really lose much. The film tells the story of a young nun who begins to question her faith after discovering a sinister conspiracy buried inside the Catholic church that involves giving birth to the antichrist to bring people back to religion. That horrific premise, and the movie’s general cynicism about religion, gives the movie weight that has nothing to do with its status as a prequel. It features a revelatory performance from Nell Tiger Free The entire cast of The First Omen is excellent, but Nell Tiger Free is in a class by herself in the central role. As Margaret, the nun uncovering this conspiracy, she manages to create a character who feels real, and who uncovers genuinely startling revelations about the world she believed she was inhabiting. It can be difficult to play a good person, but Free manages to do exactly that, creating a compelling heroine who wants nothing more than to do what is right, and is finding herself stymied by the very organization she believed in more than anything else. It’s terrifying without leaning in to horror conventions Directing an effective horror movie can be done in dozens of different ways, but the hardest task for every horror movie is to do something that feels not just scary but genuinely unsettling. Director Arkasha Stevenson manages to do exactly that, chronicling Margaret as she uncovers dark forces and realizes that the young girls who have been convinced of their own evil are being manipulated by those around them. There is plenty of horrific, supernatural stuff at work in The First Omen , but some of the film’s darkest and most upsetting moments come when Margaret discovers what the people around her are willing to do. The First Omen is streaming on Disney+ via the Hulu bundle.",

      "description": "iA announced that it will no longer develop the Android version of its iA Writer focused writing app because of Google policy changes.The post iA Writer Abandons Android, Citing Google Play Policy Changes appeared first on Thurrott.com.",
      "content": "iA announced that it will no longer develop focused writing app because of Google policy changes. (iA Writer is one of my favorite Markdown apps.) “A couple of months ago, Google changed its API policy and revoked iA Writer’s access to Google Drive on Android,” . “By freezing up Android’s main storage option, our app was frozen in carbonite. It still lived, but we couldn’t move forward before resolving it.” Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday — get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! What follows is a long story, but the short version is that Google kept moving the goal posts on iA: It repeatedly changed the requirements iA had to meet, told the company that it’s app would only get read-only access to Google Drive–when a document creation app obviously needs write privileges–and then changed the rules again when iA complained. “In order to get our users full access to Google Drive on devices, we now needed to pass a yearly CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) audit,” the company continues. “This requires hiring a third-party vendor like KPMG.” According to iA, the cost of this audit, combined with the cost it incurred trying to update the app, would amount to one or two months of revenues. Not the app’s revenues, the entire company’s revenues. And this would be a recurring, annual expense. iA Writer has been available on Android for seven years–there are versions for Mac, Windows, iPhone, and iPad as well–and it has tens of thousands of users on Google’s mobile platform. But this issue over Google Drive was just the latest in a long series of problems iA has experienced with Google, including a much higher rate of piracy than it sees on any other platform. Some of the examples iA provides are incredible, including the sheer number of devices it needs to purchase to ensure its app works properly everywhere. “Developing for Android, you navigate an asteroid field,” iA explains. “Bugs surface across thousands of device types, Android versions, and flavors—One UI, MIUI, OxygenOS, Pixel Experience, you name it. And before anyone says this is the price of an ‘open’ OS—well, we don’t have this problem on Windows. Each flavor of Android brings its own quirks. Even if we buy the troublemaking devices, the issue often turns out to be a problem with a specific subflavor or software version that’s impossible to reproduce. It’s like playing Whack-a-Mole, and the moles just keep multiplying.” Ultimately, iA came to the obvious conclusion: It just doesn’t make sense to continue developing and supporting its app for a platform on which almost no one pays for it, piracy is rampant, and the platform maker keeps imposing expensive, additional rules, taking away its control of its own app. If regulators force changes on Google that change how Android works, it may return. But for now, iA Writer for Android is “frozen in Carbonite” and will not be updated along with the other versions of the app. As a fan of iA Writer, I am excited to discover that the company will soon deliver a major Windows 11 update. That’s fantastic: I love the app, but it’s lackluster on Windows, especially when compared to the Mac. But I’m surprised to discover how terrible Android has been for the company.

      "description": "Not sure what the best streaming combo is for variety and savings? Learn about the only three premium streaming services you need.",
      "content": "Remember when you only had a few premium streaming services to choose from? Now that we have numerous options, it’s hard to find the best combo, but I’ve discovered that these three services give me everything I need, while still saving me money. I’m sure some will disagree, and of course, you’re always free to pick the best services for you, but the most cost-effective combo I’ve found is: For less than $60 a month (or $43/month with ads), you get thousands of shows and movies, millions of ad-free YouTube videos, and millions of songs. Currently, the Disney+/Hulu/Max bundle is one of the best streaming deals in terms of just how much content and variety you get. After trying multiple services, I found myself watching Disney, Hulu, and Max more than other premium streaming services. When you buy the bundle, you save nearly 40 percent over getting each separately. Now, I will admit, if you’re a huge sports fan, you may prefer the bundle with ESPN versus Max. But you can watch some live sports on Max. What makes me stick with these three bundled together are: I’ve tried the ad-supported version, and it wasn’t bad. For most movies and shows, I had anywhere from two to five minutes of commercials throughout, divided between two to four ad breaks. But the ads play at weird times, and frankly, I just didn’t want to sit through ads. For me, the cost savings alone is worth it for the bundle. For example, the Netflix Standard plan without ads is $15.49/month. For less than twice this price, I get three premium streaming services. Plus, there’s just not enough original content I enjoy to keep me coming back. Amazon Prime costs $14.99/month or $139/year. Of course, if you often use many of the other Prime benefits , Amazon Prime is worth subscribing to. But since Amazon added in ads and requires an extra $3/month to go ad-free, it makes the ad-free Amazon Prime Video $17.99/month. Admittedly, I have Amazon Prime for free shipping, but rarely watch anything. I can’t stand the interface. It’s so confusing trying to figure out what’s included and what’s to buy/rent. When I’m on a streaming app, it shouldn’t be a scavenger hunt to find what’s included in my subscription. If you told me that I could only have one premium streaming service, YouTube Premium would be it. If you often watch YouTube, you’re probably tired of being force-fed an increasing number of ads. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had videos freeze because an ad didn’t load right. For me, the cost of going ad-free is well worth it because I use YouTube in a variety of ways, including: Just to give you an idea of how much time you save going ad-free, I watched YouTube normally for a week, which ended up being two to three hours a day. This includes time I was listening, but not watching. I had to watch/listen to approximately 30 minutes of ads each day. In a week, I get an extra 3.5 hours of content just by eliminating ads. You’re probably asking yourself why bother with Spotify if YouTube Music Premium is included with YouTube Premium. For me, it’s because YouTube does a horrible job at keeping their apps separate. I can customize artists, create playlists, and like as many songs as I want on YouTube Music, but if I listen to one lo-fi video on YouTube, 90 percent of YouTube Music recommendations are lo-fi. Just because I watch something, doesn’t mean I want it on a music playlist. Hopefully, one day, YouTube will listen to subscribers and not merge content between the two services/apps. Until then, I prefer Spotify. Plus, it seems to work better in terms of recommending new music I’d actually like. I was using Spotify for two years before YouTube Premium, so I don’t want to have to start over with a new service when I’ve broken in Spotify so well – or substitute with any Spotify alternative . Before you say you need more variety, I’ve yet to run out of stuff to watch or listen to. But I do like to supplement my three premium streaming services with a few free ones . They offer live channels, news, on-demand content, and original content. Personally, Pluto TV (great for CBS content), Tubi (check out the latest FOX reality TV), and Freevee (catch some Amazon Prime content here) are my favorites. Saving money with streaming services boils down to choosing the best options for you. For me, these three have everything I want. Image credit: Unsplash . All screenshots by Crystal Crowder.

      "content": "Paris: French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday that immigration was not necessarily a \"bad\" thing, in a thinly veiled riposte to the country's hardline interior minister who has vowed to crack down on migration. \"Is immigration bad? The answer is no. It depends\", Macron told broadcaster France Inter. \"Is immigration from Africa bad in general? In truth, not totally\", Macron said in remarks recorded earlier this week and broadcast on Saturday. On Friday and Saturday, Macron hosted dozens of leaders of French-speaking countries for the \"Francophonie\" summit, the first time the event has been held in France for 33 years. He hopes the gathering will help boost French influence in a world beset by crises, in particular Africa. The African continent receives more from immigrants in Europe sending remittances home than from European public development aid, Macron said. \"Shame on us,\" he said. \"All this is much more complex than people want to admit\", Macron added, pointing to the \"ethical and political tension\" on the issue. Macron also said foreign-born French people helped make France stronger. \"There are millions of dual nationals in our country. There are at least as many French people of immigrant origin,\" Macron added. \"This is our wealth. And it is a strength,\" he added. \"The difficulty at the moment is how we manage to fight against human traffickers, these illegal immigration networks,\" he said. France's new right-wing government has pledged to clamp down on immigration and fight people traffickers. A two-year-old child was crushed to death and several adult migrants died in two separate tragedies overnight Friday to Saturday when their overcrowded boats tried to cross the Channel to Britain, French officials said. France's new interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, has vowed new immigration rules to \"protect the French,\" adding that he did not think that immigration presented \"an opportunity\" for France. Retailleau also said that \"the rule of law is neither intangible nor sacred.\" His appointment is emblematic of the rightward shift of the government under new Prime Minister Michel Barnier following this summer's legislative elections that resulted in a hung parliament.",

But the historic property, a tourist attraction known for its gardens and outdoor adventure, tours, exhibitions and restaurants, will be closed temporarily, the estate announced in a social media post this week, becoming yet another victim of the hurricane. The entrance to Biltmore and other low-lying areas, such as its farm, experienced significant wind, flooding, and building damage, the post said. There was some luck, however, as damage to the conservatory, winery, gardens, and hotels were minimal. “We are still assessing impacts to the estate from Tropical Storm Helene and that will take some time,” the estate said. “Like all of this region, the damage varies. In forested areas, which is a large portion of the estate, wind damage is extensive to grounds and some structures.” The post also said crews are clearing roads to start repairs. Hurricane Helene and its unrelenting floods has killed at least 223 people across the Southeast, and the death toll could continue to climb as dozens of people remain unaccounted for since the storm made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26. In western North Carolina this week, including Asheville and surrounding Buncombe County, uprooted homes, submerged vehicles and sunken roads illustrate the devastation inflicted by an unforgiving hurricane. Thousands of trees were toppled in Helene’s fury, mangled train tracks were left discarded on river beds and school buses were blown away. George Vanderbilt, who opened Biltmore during the Gilded Age in 1895, is a Staten Island, New York, native and grandson of industrialist Cornelius “Commodore” Vanderbilt, who established the family’s wealth in the mid-1800s through shipping and railroad monopolies.",

      "description": "ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) — Tyrrell Hatton birdied his last two holes and tied the Old Course record at St.",
      "content": "ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) — Tyrrell Hatton birdied his last two holes and tied the Old Course record at St. Andrews with an 11-under 61, giving him a one-shot lead over Nicolas Colsaerts going into the final round of the Dunhill Links Championship on Saturday. Hatton already is a two-time winner of this European tour event that pairs professionals and amateurs from the celebrity and business world over three courses. He is on pace to break his 72-hole tournament record from his 2017 victory. Hatton took a little off his 7-iron and hit it to 3 feet on the fabled Road Hole 17th for birdie and finished with a 10-foot birdie on the closing hole. That put him at 22-under 194, low scoring that reflects the benign conditions at St. Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns. Hatton holds the tournament record of 24-under par. “I was just taking each hole as it came and just trying to make as many birdies as I could,” Hatton said. \"I knew when I holed that putt on 17, I had actually shot 10 under here before. I really wanted to birdie the last. That’s actually my lowest round on tour, as well. “Good putt and thankfully it went in. It was a cool day.” Colsaerts had a cool moment of his own. He was at Kingsbarns and made an albatross 2 on the par-5 16th hole. His 6-iron bounded well past the pin up a slope, stopped and then rolled back down into the cup. Colsaerts had a chance to tie Hatton for the lead until missing the fairway on the par-5 ninth, his finishing hole, leaving him unable to reach the green in two. His par gave him a 65, still well within range of winning for the first time in five years. “Super special,” Colsaerts said. “An albatross is pretty rare.” Rory McIlroy had reason to think he was headed for a special day when he went out in 29 at St. Andrews with seven birdies in nine holes. He drove the green on the par-4 10th and had just over 5 feet for another birdie. McIlroy missed the putt and didn't make a birdie on the back nine. He was 10 shots worse — a 39 on the inward nine — for a 68 that left him 12 shots behind. Romain Langasque had a 61 at St. Andrews in 2022, while Ross Fisher was the first to set the Old Course mark in 2017. The lowest at St. Andrews for the British Open is 63. The pins typically are easier for the Dunhill Links to not make it overly difficult for amateur players. The power brokers in golf — PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan and Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia — won't be around for Sunday's final round at St. Andrews. Their teams finished well outside the 20 pro-am teams that advance. PIF and the PGA Tour have been negotiating in the last 16 months on a deal to make the Saudi's sovereign wealth fund a minority investor in the commercial PGA Tour Enterprises, and possibly lead to repairing golf's fractured landscape. Hatton is among 14 players from PIF-backed LIV Golf playing in the European tour event. They are banned from PGA Tour events. Tom Vaillant of France had a 64 at Kingsbarns and was in third, three shots behind, while Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen had a 61 at Kingsbarns and was five behind. Tommy Fleetwood was another shot back after a 67 that left him disappointed, mainly because the Old Course is susceptible to low scoring without much wind. “When the Old Course is like this, if you hit it half-decent off the tee, you can give yourself a lot of chances,” Fleetwood said. “Five under, bogey-free, it sounds good. But it was a bit of a frustrating one. Fair play to the guys who shot amazing scores.\" ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf The Associated Press",

      "description": "After a week of virtual immersion in the Ambani festivities, an indignant friend asked me: ‘This wedding, why would anyone do something like that?’, ‘Such extravagance — won’t people in your country get upset? Won’t...",
      "content": "After a week of virtual immersion in the Ambani festivities, an indignant friend asked me: ‘This wedding, why would anyone do something like that?’, ‘Such extravagance — won’t people in your country get upset? Won’t the Ambanis get into trouble?’ I said no. Why was I so sure? It was extravagant — the most expensive wedding anywhere on the globe in modern memory. Estimates of the amount spent seem to be in the range of $500 million, including the groom’s multimillion dollar watch and several million more in watches for the 25 best men (all best?) at a quarter million dollars a pop. And the food. One Instagrammer claims that 2,500-odd dishes were served over the days of the celebration, all vegetarian. My attempt to list all the vegetarian dishes I know finished well below a thousand, so perhaps this is an exaggeration, but clearly many hundreds were served. It made me think what I would do faced with so much choice: there is a justly famous experiment by Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper showing that when buyers in a supermarket were offered 24 different jams and preserves to choose from, rather than just 6, they were actually less likely to go home with a jam. The plethora of choices ends up paralysing the chooser. I suspect something like that would happen to me at the chaat stand at the Ambani wedding that was much written about, though the tamatar ki chaat I surely would not have missed. So, it was an exercise in excess and a very visible one. Why wasn’t it seen as a potentially provocative act in a country where the total annual spending on MGNREGA, the Indian government’s most important anti-poverty program covering nearly 15 crore beneficiaries, is only about ten times the amount spent on this wedding? Why would 15,000 people get to enjoy over a few days, what could be an economic lifeline for 1.5 crore people for an entire year? Did the Ambanis expect it to be unpopular but assume that their power will protect them? I don’t think so. PM Narendra Modi and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee attended and they are both very savvy political spirits, representing very different constituencies and unlikely to touch anything that the public hates. The most likely answer is that most Indians, unlike my (non-Indian) friend, didn’t see this as something particularly offensive. After all, in late-19th and early-20-century Bengal, neighbouring zamindars with too much money and too little to do literally organised weddings for their cats (biraler biye) and even their ponds (pukurer biye) just so that they could enjoy a great party. This was at a time when many people lived on one meal a day in these villages. My guess is that the average low-income Indian expects very little of the very rich. Indeed, our wealthy have so often trampled on the rights of the rest — to take a particularly awful example, zamindars insisting that they get to deflower every new bride — that the poor might be grateful as long as they are left to their own devices. For many others, the point is simple: we have chosen an economic system (for better, or likely, for the worse) that enables breathtaking wealth accumulation. Why then fret about the way the wealthy spend their wealth? Maybe better a spectacle like this one, where lots of jobs get created in feeding the guests and in making flower arrangements, than buying expensive paintings or funding classical music. And since everyone in India tries to do their best for their children’s weddings, why not the Ambanis? What it does mean, however, is that we shouldn’t be swayed by the right-wing idea that taxes on the rich need to be low because they are uniquely positioned to create jobs and incomes by investing their wealth. Buying expensive watches made in Europe does not count as investment. The more interesting question to me is why all of this was worth it for the Ambanis. The great American social theorist, Thorstein Veblen, in his analysis of the rising American plutocracy of the late-19th century, emphasised their need for legitimation. They consumed to show that they had arrived, to stake their claim for social influence against that of the previous generation of the rich — the Boston Brahmins, the New York ‘Aristocracy’ (often of Dutch descent), the descendants of the Virginia tobacco growers and so on. And for that reason, their mansions needed to be bigger, their yachts that much more lavish. Consumption, as Veblen noted, needed to be conspicuous. But I don’t think this explains it. Hardly anyone in India needs to be persuaded that the Ambanis have arrived. Reliance is in every household, often in more forms than one. And while they are still not quite on the global firmament of the ultra-rich, they are savvy enough to know that some of their wedding guests, Zuckerberg (and several others) for example, could have easily outspent them but opted not to. Moreover, as Veblen astutely pointed out, the compulsion to distinguish yourselves quite naturally seeks out originality and refinement. In order to avoid stultification, he must also cultivate his tastes, for it now becomes incumbent on him to discriminate with some nicety between the noble and the ignoble in consumable goods. He becomes a connoisseur in creditable viands of various degrees of merit, in manly beverages and trinkets, in seemly apparel and architecture, in weapons, games, dancers, and narcotics. In fact, gastronomy, as a category, is clearly associated with the rise of the bourgeoisie and its desire to challenge the aristocracy’s hold on the high culture of France. It was not mere plenty that signalled the arrival of a new dominant class, but also the refinement of taste, exemplified by the very architectural cakes and pastries that Antonin Carême made famous in early 19th century Paris. This is precisely what we did not see. There was good food, of course. Traditional Gujarati food was specifically mentioned, and I wished I had some details because my knowledge of that particular cuisine hardly extends beyond the wonderful khandvi and undhiyu. Well-known restaurants across the world came with multiple cuisines. But the star turn, from what I read, might have come from the chaatwala. The emphasis was on comfort at a grand scale. In the end, my theory of this particular wedding is perhaps uninteresting as a piece of social science. There was, if I had to guess, no ulterior motive behind the Ambani splurge — they did it because they could, because it was what they wanted. A party to end all parties, the last chance, perhaps, to have one in this generation with the full legitimacy that a wedding celebration affords. They did not want to be original, rather, just to affirm India’s growing reputation as home to the most over-the-top wedding celebrations. The fact that they may not have been driven by social pressure does not mean that other Indians will not be. I worry that parents planning a wedding today might feel that they are not doing enough; of course, they can’t match the Ambanis, but why not a bit more and just a bit more. Marianne Bertrand and Adair Morse from the University of Chicago have some interesting work on what they call ‘trickle-down consumption’. Apparently, in American states where the rich consume more in a particular year, the non-rich also end up consuming more in the same period, even when their incomes do not go up commensurately. They argue that this is either because the rich set the norms for consumption or the availability of more expensive consumer goods (more elaborate flower settings, fancier caterers, etc.) — because the rich want them — attracts the less affluent buyers, too. Either way, a lot of Indian parents already end up spending more on weddings than they can afford (especially since dowries, alas, have not gone away) and this particular show of wealth probably hasn’t helped. Finally, all this makes me wish that our rich had different priorities, especially given that I don’t see the political will to tax them much more. In a sense, the precise fact that the Ambanis were under no compulsion to spend the way they did suggests that if somebody in their family decides to go in a different direction, they would be free to do so. Some of the best-known foundations in the world — Rockefeller, Carnegie, Mellon, among others — came out of the Gilded Age, exactly the period and the culture that Veblen was writing about. In India, the Tatas and Azim Premji, among others, have already shown that there are other ways for the ultra-rich to spend their wealth, but it is clearly yet to take root. Maybe now that the weddings are over, the next extravagance can be an act of generosity that is even more visible than the Kardashians. This is part of a monthly column by Nobel-winning economist Abhijit Banerjee illustrated by Cheyenne Olivier Recipe: The urge to make something glorious and unexpected is something we all share. This is something easy enough to make, that has the right kind of oomph. MANGO MOUSSE WITH NANKHATAI For the nankhatai 75 gm wheat flour 65 gm sugar 60 gm ghee 25 gm chickpea flour 1⁄4 tsp baking powder 3 green cardamom pods For the mousse 250 gm mango purée 250 gm full-fat cream 40 gm sugar 3 gm gelatine sheets 1/3 cup pistachios 10 strands of saffron To make the nankhatai, take a mixing bowl and mix together all the dry ingredients – wheat flour, sugar, chickpea flour and baking powder. Infuse the ghee with a cardamom pod. Grind the 2 remaining cardamom pods in the mixer and add to the dry mix. Add the cardamom-infused ghee into the mixing bowl and lightly bring together the mixture with your fingers till it forms a dough that is crumbly but stiff. Divide the dough into 12 balls and slightly press them down. Bake for 10 minutes at 180°C. To prepare the mango mousse, put the gelatine sheets in cold water to rehydrate. Add 250 gm full-fat cream with 40 gm sugar to a bowl and place the mixture in the fridge. Meanwhile, gently heat 125 gm mango purée in a saucepan till it is just warm and throw in the saffron strands. Now, bring out the mixing bowl with the cream and sugar from the fridge, and whisk the mixture till the cream is close to being firm. While the mango purée is still warm, melt in the gelatine and mix well. Add in the other half of the mango purée, making sure that the mixture is lukewarm rather than cold (gently heat the spiced purée if need be). Add in about one-third of the whipped cream and gently integrate into the purée. Now add in the rest of the whipped cream using slow and regular movements till it is fully mixed. Put the mousse in serving bowls and place these bowls in the fridge for 2 hours. Place a nankhatai on top and garnish the mousse with crushed, toasted pistachio bits before serving.

      "content": "Paris: French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday that immigration was not necessarily a \"bad\" thing, in a thinly veiled riposte to the country's hardline interior minister who has vowed to crack down on migration. \"Is immigration bad? The answer is no. It depends\", Macron told broadcaster France Inter. \"Is immigration from Africa bad in general? In truth, not totally\", Macron said in remarks recorded earlier this week and broadcast on Saturday. On Friday and Saturday, Macron hosted dozens of leaders of French-speaking countries for the \"Francophonie\" summit, the first time the event has been held in France for 33 years. He hopes the gathering will help boost French influence in a world beset by crises, in particular Africa. The African continent receives more from immigrants in Europe sending remittances home than from European public development aid, Macron said. \"Shame on us,\" he said. \"All this is much more complex than people want to admit\", Macron added, pointing to the \"ethical and political tension\" on the issue. Macron also said foreign-born French people helped make France stronger. \"There are millions of dual nationals in our country. There are at least as many French people of immigrant origin,\" Macron added. \"This is our wealth. And it is a strength,\" he added. \"The difficulty at the moment is how we manage to fight against human traffickers, these illegal immigration networks,\" he said. France's new right-wing government has pledged to clamp down on immigration and fight people traffickers. A two-year-old child was crushed to death and several adult migrants died in two separate tragedies overnight Friday to Saturday when their overcrowded boats tried to cross the Channel to Britain, French officials said. France's new interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, has vowed new immigration rules to \"protect the French,\" adding that he did not think that immigration presented \"an opportunity\" for France. Retailleau also said that \"the rule of law is neither intangible nor sacred.\" His appointment is emblematic of the rightward shift of the government under new Prime Minister Michel Barnier following this summer's legislative elections that resulted in a hung parliament.",

      "description": "It emerged that the British Heart Foundation told a senior Sinn Fein official that two press officers had provided references for Michael McMonagle.",
      "content": "It emerged on Saturday that Sinn Fein had known one year ago that two of its press officers had provided references for former employee Michael McMonagle for a job at the British Heart Foundation (BHF). The party moved last week to sack the two press officers, and indicated that September 25 was the first they knew of the references being provided. But the BHF said it told a senior Sinn Fein official about the references for McMonagle in August 2023. Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill apologised on behalf of the party for the provision of the references. Last month, McMonagle, 42, from Limewood Street, Londonderry, admitted a series of offences, including attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity. Sinn Fein has been facing questions over the way it handled the matter. Ms O’Neill and the head of the BHF in Northern Ireland, Fearghal McKinney, spoke earlier on Saturday about the fall-out from the case. But DUP leader Gavin Robinson said Sinn Fein’s explanations “have not withstood scrutiny”. He has challenged Ms O’Neill to make a statement and take questions at Stormont. “It’s time for full transparency from Sinn Fein. Is the truth being hid or is there a total lack of competence? It’s time for honesty,” he said. “Sinn Fein explanations have not withstood scrutiny. With every new revelation undermining a previous Sinn Fein position, this issue requires deeper scrutiny.” McMonagle was first arrested in August 2021. Sinn Fein has said it suspended him as soon as it became aware of the police investigation and his employment was terminated in June 2022 when his contract ended. He went on to work for BHF from September 2022. On Saturday, the BHF said it is confident it undertook all necessary statutory and moral duties required throughout the entire process. In a statement, Ms O’Neill said the two press officers who provided references have lost their positions with the party and are also no longer party members. Ms O’Neill also said that she established on Thursday that in August 2023, following media reports of charges against McMonagle, BHF contacted Sinn Fein’s former HR manager to verify the email address and identity of the senior press officer who had provided the reference the previous year, which the HR manager did. She said this contact from the BHF was not brought to her attention, or the attention of the Sinn Fein leadership, at that time, which she termed “a serious omission”. “Michael McMonagle’s actions are utterly reprehensible and he is being held fully accountable under the law. His crimes have inflicted significant harm on his innocent victims. There is nothing more reprehensible than the abuse of a child,” she said. Ms O’Neill said she was made aware of his suspension and had no further contact with him. She was pictured at an event which McMonagle had attended in Parliament Buildings in February 2023. Ms O’Neill reiterated that she had not been aware he was at the event, adding she “had no knowledge that he had gained employment with the British Heart Foundation”. She apologised on behalf of Sinn Fein for the actions of the press officers. “On Wednesday September 25, 2024, Sinn Fein and I were informed that two press officers, who were former colleagues of Michael McMonagle, had provided employment references for him,” she said. “I am absolutely appalled and horrified that this occurred. These references were given without the knowledge or authorisation of the party. Under no circumstances would the party provide a reference, for work or otherwise, for Michael McMonagle. “On behalf of Sinn Fein, I apologise for the hurt and distress caused by their actions.” She added: “This morning, I spoke with Fearghal McKinney, head of the British Heart Foundation NI, to discuss this situation. “This is an organisation that does great work providing support, research and advocacy services. I am deeply sorry that they have been caught up in this unacceptable situation. “I look forward to a continued constructive relationship with the British Heart Foundation in promoting heart health. “Sinn Fein will be issuing instructions to all managers and members of staff regarding future requests for character references. “As a political leader and a mother, I want to be clear that the issue of child safeguarding is of paramount importance to me. The Sinn Fein leadership and I will ensure that a situation like this will never arise again.” Mr McKinney said during his telephone call with Ms O’Neill, he “outlined the processes the BHF undertook in hiring this individual, determining his suitability for employment including full reference checks and the robust internal investigation we undertook after learning of the serious charges against him”. He added: “Michelle O’Neill agreed recent comments by her and party colleagues questioning the BHF’s due diligence process were unhelpful and she expressed regret for the damage and upset this has caused to our dedicated staff and supporters. “I wish to reiterate that the BHF is confident we undertook all necessary statutory and moral duties required throughout this entire process. “Our staff and volunteers in Northern Ireland have been devastated by this issue and our focus now must be on supporting them and focusing on what we are here to do – funding lifesaving research to find the cures and treatments for heart and circulatory disease. “Lastly, our thoughts are with the children and their families who are the ultimate victims of these terrible crimes.”",

Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters A horrifying dog attack in a London street has left two young children and a woman with severe injuries, necessitating urgent hospital treatment. The incident which unfolded around 9am on Mickleham Road in St Paul's Cray, just north of Orpington, reportedly involved four dogs launching an unprovoked attack on a four year old, a six year old, and a 30 year old woman. In response, police, including armed units, swarmed the suburban road, subdued the animals, and transferred them to police kennels. A woman has subsequently been detained under suspicion of having dogs dangerously out of control and is presently in custody, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. According to reports, the three victims were taken to the hospital where they are fortunately not believed to be suffering from life-threatening conditions. An official statement given to The Mirror by the London Ambulance Service revealed: \"We were called at 8.49am this morning (5 October) to reports of an incident in Mickleham Lane, Orpington. We sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews, an advanced paramedic and an incident response officer. \"We also dispatched London's Air Ambulance. We treated one adult and two children at the scene and took them all to a major trauma centre by road.\" Mickleham Road is currently under police blockade as detectives delve into the recent incident, prompting a warning of a heightened police presence in the upcoming days. Superintendent Mitch Carr from the South Area BCU expressed his understanding of the community's anxiety. He stated: \"I know this incident will have caused a lot of public concern, especially due to the young age of the children injured. Fortunately, it is believed that none of the injuries are life-threatening. A woman has been arrested on suspicion of having dogs dangerously out of control and she has been taken into custody. The dogs have also been taken to police kennels while the investigation is ongoing. Extra officers will be in the area over the next few days to provide community reassurance\", reports the Mirror . An eyewitness account from a gentleman to The Mirror described the harrowing ordeal where he stepped in to aid the young victims. He relayed: \"I saw the dogs biting the girl, so I had to run over there and separate the girl, when I saw another little boy (...) who the dogs were also biting. \"I know this incident will have caused a lot of public concern, especially due to the young age of the children injured.

      "content": "Pensacola, United States: The only road to Pensacola, in the remote mountains of western North Carolina, is now a muddy path through deep, twisting gorges. Its main bridges were swept away last week in floods fueled by devastating Hurricane Helene -- and a cold winter is coming. \"Every major bridge into town is completely gone,\" Christy Edwards, a resident of the valley, told AFP. She was speaking near the site of her former craft shop -- carried away by the fast-moving floodwaters. The isolation of this steep-sided valley, where Edwards was born and has spent her life, speaks of the utter ruination inflicted by Helene on some of the more secluded corners of the southeastern United States. Even a week after the powerful storm's passage, access to the area is only slowly being restored. But \"winter is coming,\" said Edwards, a former teacher, and at an altitude of some 3,000 feet (900 meters), time is running short. Temperatures are expected to drop sharply next week, and \"these people and these homes have no heat source other than power, (though) some of them do have wood-burning stoves.\" Not far away, past the jumbled mass of tangled tree limbs and rocks that Helene left strewn across her yard, the local fire station has become a beehive of activity, with free food, friendly faces, and a generator providing light and comfort to huddled residents. Janet Musselwhite, in her 60s, has come with friend Randi to try to use the station's satellite internet link to contact relatives. \"We're devastated,\" she said. \"We don't have electricity. Most people don't have water. We have no cell service. We have very little communication. It's really hard to even get to town.\" The only road into the valley is impassable except in a four-by-four -- and even that is risky. The storm claimed at least one life in the Pensacola area, that of a woman who, according to her neighbor, was swept away in one of the dozens of mudslides that carved paths of desolation on area slopes early the morning of September 27. Helene has claimed at least 220 lives overall, making it the second most deadly storm to strike the US in more than a half-century, behind 2005's Hurricane Katrina. Scientists say Helene's rare intensity was almost certainly amplified by the warming of the seas caused by climate change. But the mountains of western North Carolina normally escape the worst of passing hurricanes, which tend to inflict their greatest damage in low-lying coastal areas. No one in this area had ever seen anything like this. At the fire station, David Rogers, a bearded military veteran in a gray T-shirt, showed videos on his phone of the floods that carried away the mobile homes once parked just below his house. Their inhabitants escaped, but \"three had to go to the hospital.\" Mobile homes are fragile dwellings, highly vulnerable to nature's extremes, and their presence bespeaks the deep poverty of rural settings like this across the US. Rogers said he and the survivors from the mobile homes were completely cut off from the outside world for three days. Rescue teams finally arrived, and behind them, a steady stream of backhoes and bulldozers. Work crews have been struggling from dusk to dawn to reopen roads that were left under mountains of mud and broken chunks of asphalt by the power of fast-flowing water. One man drives by on a noisy four-wheeler with rolls of paper towels tied to the back. Amid all the din and the clamor, the authorities are maintaining a quiet presence. Near the fire station, across from a huge camper lying on its side against a white church, Shawn Lavin, a national guardsman from New York, is part of a dozen-member team helping out. Their chief, who declined to give his name, said that between the official relief teams, the locals, and volunteers come from far away -- some even arriving in their own helicopters -- \"it's messy.\" For many residents, the federal presence arrived too late, and the process of applying for emergency assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is too complicated, requiring computer access. \"These people don't even have a computer, they don't have power,\" said Christy Edwards, who said she felt \"forgotten.\" \"We need physical people here to walk up to each individual house and say, 'How can we help you?'\" In this remote corner of the Appalachian mountains, people have \"always felt forgotten because we are in a rural area,\" she said. \"We have never asked for help. But this is way bigger than our resources here. We have to have help from our government to fix back.\"",

      "content": "New Delhi: Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu on Sunday will arrive here for a state visit to India from October 6-10 following an official invitation extended by his Indian counterpart Droupadi Murmu, an official said. This will be Muizzu’s first bilateral visit after assuming office. He is scheduled to hold high-level meetings with President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior officials of the Indian government. In a statement on Friday, The President’s Office (Maldives) stated: “President Dr Muizzu remains committed to enhancing bilateral ties with nations that play a crucial role in the development and growth of the Maldives, ensuring a dynamic and proactive foreign policy for the nation... Discussions will focus on strengthening bilateral cooperation and further enhancing the longstanding relationship between the two nations.” Earlier this year, the Maldives President had attended the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Modi and the Council of Ministers at Rashtrapati Bhavan here on June 9. Before that, he also met PM Modi on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai on December 1 last year. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that the Maldives President, accompanied by a high-level delegation from his country, will also be visiting Mumbai and Bengaluru, where he will have business engagements. “The visit signifies the importance India attaches to its relations with Maldives. It is expected to lend further momentum to cooperation and robust people-to-people ties between the two countries,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal during a weekly media briefing on Friday. In August, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar visited Maldives on an official three-day visit, his first since assuming office for a second term in June. Before that, he had previously visited the strategically-significant Indian Ocean archipelago in January 2023 as India maintained that Maldives occupies an important place in New Delhi’s vision of ‘Neighbourhood First’ and ‘SAGAR’. “The visit of President Dr. Muizzu to India after the recent visit of the External Affairs Minister to Maldives is testimony to the importance that India attaches to its relations with the Maldives,” the External Affairs Ministry said in a statement on Friday. Even as the relationship between the two countries became strained last year, India remained a key provider of development assistance to the island nation with several projects funded by India benefitting the lives of thousands of people in the country. Muizzu’s upcoming visit is considered important as India and Maldives experienced a decline in bilateral relations after he assumed office in 2023 on the plank of his ‘India Out’ election campaigning. After taking office in November 2023, Muizzu requested India to withdraw its military personnel from his country.",

      "content": "New Delhi, Oct 5 (PTI) A personal security officer (PSO) of a businessman was arrested for allegedly robbing cash and jewellery worth Rs 1.25 crore from his employer's house in south Delhi's Greater Kailash area, police said on Saturday. Vikas Kumar’s (38) employer had gone out of the country on a vacation when he hatched a plan to carry out the robbery, they said. He jumped into the businessman’s house from the terrace and decamped with the gold jewellery and cash, they said. The matter came to fore when the complainant returned home and found the locker broken. Around Rs 70 lakhs cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 55 lakhs were missing from the safe, Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Ankit Chauhan said. A case under relevant sections of theft was registered at Greater Kailash Police Station and teams were formed to nab the robber, the police said. “After analysing the CCTV footage of areas nearby, it was found that at around 2 am on September 26, a person came in a car and entered the house,\" Chauhan said. The footages were shown to the complainant who identified him as his PSO Vikas Kumar, a native of Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat. The businessman had hired the accused three months ago, he said. Kumar was arrested on Thursday and the stolen cash and jewellery was recovered from his house in Baghpat. The car used in the commission of crime was also found there, the DCP said. Another police officer said Kumar revealed that he planned the robbery to live a lavish life and on the night of the incident he used a rope to climb on the terrace of the house. He entered inside by breaking the locks. Kumar also tampered with the CCTV cameras before entering the house but he was captured on cameras installed in the nearby lanes, the officer said.",

      "content": "ASHEVILLE, N.C. — America’s largest privately-owned estate has abruptly shut down in Asheville after Hurricane Helene caused extensive flooding and building damage along the 8,000 acre property. The iconic Biltmore Estate , situated in the Blue Ridge Mountains, spans 175,000 square feet, boasts 250 rooms, 43 bathrooms, 65 fireplaces and 22 miles of walking trail. But the historic property, a tourist attraction known for its gardens and outdoor adventure, tours, exhibitions and restaurants, will be closed temporarily, the estate announced in a social media post this week, becoming yet another victim of the hurricane. The entrance to Biltmore and other low-lying areas, such as its farm, experienced significant wind, flooding, and building damage, the post said. There was some luck, however, as damage to the conservatory, winery, gardens, and hotels were minimal. “We are still assessing impacts to the estate from Tropical Storm Helene and that will take some time,” the estate said. “Like all of this region, the damage varies. In forested areas, which is a large portion of the estate, wind damage is extensive to grounds and some structures.” The post also said crews are clearing roads to start repairs. Hurricane Helene and its unrelenting floods has killed at least 223 people across the Southeast, and the death toll could continue to climb as dozens of people remain unaccounted for since the storm made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26. In western North Carolina this week, including Asheville and surrounding Buncombe County, uprooted homes, submerged vehicles and sunken roads illustrate the devastation inflicted by an unforgiving hurricane. Thousands of trees were toppled in Helene’s fury, mangled train tracks were left discarded on river beds and school buses were blown away. George Vanderbilt, who opened Biltmore during the Gilded Age in 1895, is a Staten Island, New York, native and grandson of industrialist Cornelius “Commodore” Vanderbilt, who established the family’s wealth in the mid-1800s through shipping and railroad monopolies.",

      "content": "EasyJet has launched an investigation after a man managed to board a flight at Manchester Airport without the proper paperwork. It remains unclear whether he had a boarding pass for another flight or no boarding pass at all. The airline is currently trying to figure out how the man was able to get on the flight, but declined to provide any additional details as the investigation is ongoing. A spokesperson simply stated that the man had \"incorrectly boarded\". However, passengers on the flight believe the man didn't have a boarding pass, referring to the incident as a \"security breach\". It's believed the flight to Milan, Italy, was already on the runway preparing for take-off when easyJet cabin crew realised the man shouldn't have been onboard. Manchester Airport confirmed that all its security procedures were correctly followed and that the issue occurred at the airline gate. They added police are investigating the matter. Greater Manchester Police revealed that a man in his 20s was arrested and remains in custody today. He's being held on suspicion of secreting himself for the purpose of being carried in an aircraft without consent and intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance. understands nothing suspicious was found on board. The incident at Terminal One is not being treated as terror-related either. The man hasn't been named. An easyJet spokesperson confirmed: \"easyJet can confirm that flight EZY2127 from Manchester to Milan was subject to additional security checks, in line with procedures, due to a passenger incorrectly boarding the flight. Safety and security is our highest priority and so we will now work with our ground partner at Manchester Airport to understand how he was able to board the flight.\" A traveller reported that cops boarded the flight and searched the plane. The man was escorted off by officers, while stunned passengers were herded off and had to be re-screened. All bags and carry-ons were rifled through. The journey, on an easyJet jet to Milan Malpensa flight number EZY 2127 was thrown off schedule by the incident. The take-off was slated for 6.23pm last Friday, but the plane didn't leave until 11.10pm. The Airbus touched down in Milan just shy of 2am Saturday landing more than four-and-a-half hours behind because of what happened. Greater Manchester Police said: \"At around 7pm last night (Friday 4 October 2024), we were called to Manchester Airport to reports of a man who had embarked on a flight without the correct documentation. \"On arrival back to the terminal, officers arrested a man in his 20s on suspicion of secreting himself for the purpose of being carried in an aircraft without consent and intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance. \"He remains in police custody for questioning and enquiries are ongoing.\" No further details have been revealed.",

      "content": "Article content A woman is dead after her vehicle slammed into a building in east central Edmonton, continuing a worrying trend for traffic safety in the city . The 79-year-old’s Suzuki SUV was spotted Friday afternoon weaving between lanes eastbound on 118 Avenue near 67 Street. Just after 5:45 p.m., it mounted the southeast curb at 66 Street and crashed into a building. Witnesses helped the woman from the wreckage and attempted lifesaving measures until an ambulance crew arrived. EMS pronounced her dead on scene. The cause of the collision is not yet known, though the Edmonton Police Service major collisions unit continues to investigate. They are asking anyone with dash camera footage to contact Crime Stoppers or the police non-emergency line. The crash comes amid a bad year for traffic fatalities in Edmonton. In early July, police sounded the alarm about motorists on city streets, saying that as of the end of June the city had seen 15 fatal collisions, up from just 12 in the entirety of 2023. Of those, seven of the victims were pedestrians, while four were motorcyclists. There were more than double the number of traffic fatalities in 2023 (12) and in 2024 than the previous three years combined (three in 2022; six in 2021; and four in 2020). —with files from Jason Hills jwakefield@postmedia.com x.com/jonnywakefield Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the news you need to know — add EdmontonJournal.com and EdmontonSun.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here .

      "content": "Changes to Social Security are coming and The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has proposed raising the retirement age to 70 as a way to improve the program. Rachel Greszler, a senior research fellow at the Roe Institute , advocated for this change in an article for the foundation, suggesting that raising the eligibility age for Social Security benefits could help address the imminent funding crisis facing the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA’s 2023 Trustees Report, published earlier this year, warned that the trust funds supporting the largest U.S. benefits program—covering retirees, survivors, and disabled individuals—are set to run out by 2035 unless Congress acts to maintain their solvency. In her article, Greszler suggested gradually raising the normal retirement age from 67 to 69 or 70, with an incremental increase of one or two months each year, tying future changes to life expectancy. According to Greszler, “increased life expectancies, improved healthcare, and the shift away from physically demanding work” imply that many older Americans are now more capable of staying in the workforce longer than before. This, she argued, could help address the looming funding gap in Social Security. She also pointed out that keeping older workers employed could offer advantages beyond merely stabilizing Social Security’s finances. “The benefits of older workers staying in the workforce expand beyond Social Security’s solvency , and the additional income that Americans would earn. Older workers’ wisdom and experience provides an invaluable insight and mentorship to younger workers. And today’s labor market affords increasing opportunities for older workers to gradually ease into retirement, instead of abruptly exiting their careers.” Greszler acknowledged that raising the retirement age alone would not entirely solve the impending financial problems of the Social Security system . Instead, she suggested it could address only about 20 to 30 percent of the shortfall projected by 2035. “While updating Social Security’s retirement age is an important component of reform, it would only solve about 20 percent to 30 percent of the program’s shortfalls. A more accurate inflation adjustment would solve another 20 percent to 25 percent of the program’s shortfalls.” Other experts’ take on the Social Security funding crisis Other experts in Social Security and financial policy do not necessarily agree with the proposal. Stephen Kates, a principal financial analyst with RetireGuide.com , described raising the age of eligibility as “a backwards way of simplifying reducing benefits.” Although not directly commenting on Greszler’s article, Kates pointed out that raising either the earliest eligibility age of 62 or the full retirement age of 67 would mean smaller and delayed benefits for future retirees. He explained that currently, beneficiaries who start taking Social Security at 62 generally see a 30 percent reduction in their monthly payments compared to waiting until the full retirement age of 67 (for those born after 1959). The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) has previously stated that raising the retirement age for Social Security would effectively reduce benefits by an amount similar to the projected benefit cuts expected in the 2030s if no legislative action is taken to secure funding. Zachary Pleat, a senior researcher at Media Matters , also expressed concern over the Heritage Foundation’s proposal. He tied this policy recommendation to a broader political agenda, referencing Project 2025 , an initiative led by the Heritage Foundation, which aims to prepare a conservative coalition for a future administration starting in January 2025. “ The Heritage Foundation , which has played a central role in organizing the planned extremist takeover of the federal government known as Project 2025 for the next Republican president, is now calling for the Social Security retirement age to be raised to 70,” Pleat said. Project 2025 , according to its description, involves a coalition of conservative organizations seeking to ensure that a new conservative administration is ready to govern effectively starting in January 2025. This proposal to raise the Social Security retirement age is viewed by critics as part of a broader ideological push to restructure key government functions and benefits.",

      "content": "The Noon Optimist Club of Marshall met Wednesday, Oct. 2 in Hutchins Hall of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. We enjoyed a taco bar from Jucy’s. Our thanks to Optimists Le Ila and Charles Dixon for picking up the food and to Le Ila for providing pumpkin spice cakes for dessert (one a bundt ring and the other in the shape of a pumpkin with vines and leaves made of fondant! President Julie Brock called on Optimist Le Ila for the opening prayer and then led in the pledge to the flag and Optimist Creed. President Julie then welcomed the Young Texans, their families and Marshall High School school administrators, Principal Mike Miller and Associate Principal Carolyn Oliver. She explained that all the 2024-25 Young Texans had a chance at receiving one of the $500 grants awarded at random to three of the Texannes and three of the Texans at the end of year awards assembly. Optimist Julie then introduced Jiya Mistry as the Young Texanne for October. Her favorite classes are focused on healthcare. “I love science classes and any healthcare career and technical education classes — med. micro, certified clinical medical assistant.” Her favorite teachers are Erica Wilson for English language arts, Anna Day for health science, Jana Duck for algebra II and Skylyn Potts for biology. Her grade point average is 5.489. Jiya is active in extra-curricular activities such as Student Council, National Honor Society (where she serves as secretary), the senior class (where she serves as vice president), and the Interact Club (where she serves as historian). She has been on the varsity volleyball team for four years and “so far for three years” has participated in powerlifting (her top lift weight is 300 pounds!). In the area of religion, she said, “I am Hindu, so I do believe in numerous religious activities such as Garba, Diwali and many more.” Optimist Richard Magrill said that he was familiar with Diwali, a time for religious rituals and sharing traditional stories and also an opportunity to spruce up the home, buy new clothes, and, of course, enjoy parties, feasting and an exchange of gifts. (For Hindus, Diwali is linked to the ancient legend of Lord Rama, who was deprived of his kingdom and sent into exile for 14 years. It celebrates Rama’s eventual defeat of the evil spirit Ravana, and his triumphant return to his home.) However, he asked about Garba? As it turns out Garba is a nine-day festival that is not easy to give a short answer to! It is a dance that honors, worships and celebrates the feminine form of divinity. “Each day a different goddess is emphasized,” explained Shilpa Mistry. Intrigued, Optimist Richard went to Wikipedia for a little more information. “Traditionally, the dance is performed by women in a circle around a clay lantern with a light inside. The vessel itself is a symbol of the body, within whom divinity (in the form of the Goddess or Devi) resides. Garba is danced around this symbol to honor the fact that all humans have the divine energy of Devi within them. “Garba is performed in a circle (concentric circles when there are many people). The circle represents the Hindu view of time. In Hinduism, time is cyclical. As the cycle of time revolves, from birth to life to death to rebirth, the only thing that is constant is the Goddess, an unmoving symbol in the midst of all of this unending and infinite movement. The dance symbolizes that God, represented in feminine form in this case, is the only thing that remains unchanging in a constantly changing universe (jagat).” Jiya is also an artist in acrylic painting and in sketching. She won three awards during her freshman year. Asked what she most likes to paint, she replied that she liked nature, landscapes and flowers. “I mostly paint from my imagination,” she shared. Her goals include graduating from MHS and then attending college. “I am undecided as of right now between Baylor University, Texas A&M University or the University of Texas at Austin. Wherever, I end up, I plan to major in biology and attend medical school to become a cardiologist.” Optimist Melissa Al-Amadhi thanked her for choosing cardiology, as did Optimists Richard Magrill and Le Ila Dixon. She shared that her interest was sparked by the medical condition of her little sister, Nishta. In a personal message to her parents, Mukund and Shilpa Mistry, she said: “Thank you for every sacrifice, support and always be there for me, whether it is the smallest thing or the biggest, you guys are always there for me no matter the situation. From Private School Interscholastic Activity, to volleyball to power lifting and all of my academic related accomplishments, you both have been present. Thank you for always being there. I love you guys so much! I am so proud to be your daughter.” President Julie then introduced Gavin Carlisle as the Young Texan for October. His favorite subject is chemistry and his favorite teachers are Janna Duck for algebra II, Glenda Bailey for business finance, Michael Wheeler for science, Golf Coach Casey Broadus and 12th Grade Counselor Kelley Paul. His grade point average is 5.167. Gavin is active in varsity golf, the National Honor Society and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. (He is captain of the golf team!) He enjoys bass fishing (with a buddy in Fern Lake) and deer, dove and hog hunting. Optimist Le Ila asked if he and his hunting buddies “eat what they kill.” He said, “Yes, but not the hogs; they are usually too tough. However, they don’t go to waste. There is a coyote problem, so the hog carcasses are used as bait for the coyotes!” He works at Marshall Mercantile, “doing whatever is needed.” “It’s a great place to work!” In response to questions, he reported that the ice cream parlor is now open with vanilla, chocolate and strawberry on offer. “Come by and have some,” he advised. As far as college is concerned, he is leaning toward the University of Arkansas but may end up someplace else. He plans to major in finance. In a personal message to his parents, Scott and Tracy Carlile, he said: “To my mom and dad, thank y’all so much for all of the unwavering support whether it was with school, golf, baseball and everything else. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without y’all. I love y’all so much,” and added, “have fun dealing with Ian [his younger brother] over the next four years” in recognition that he’s not leaving them with an empty nest! As promised, President Julie gave new MHS Principal Mike Miller the opportunity to introduce himself. He indicated that he began his career as an educator as a band director before moving into administration. This is his first year in Marshall. Due to various issues, his family is still in the house in Arp, but he is glad to be here in his new work. “It’s really great to be in a town where the community is so supportive of the schools!” he said. He reported on the progress and anticipated completion of the various physical improvements at the high school/junior high school campus. Total high school enrollment this year now stands at 1,477, and there are approximately 350 in the senior class. The Optimists gave the Young Texans and school administrators a round of applause. President Julie presented pots of large-petalled yellow and orange fall mums to the mothers and Optimist John Fortune took pictures. Note: John takes pictures throughout the meeting and President Julie shares these with the families.",

      "content": "New Delhi, Oct 5 (PTI) Former president Ram Nath Kovind, who headed a panel on 'one nation, one election,' on Saturday said the idea of simultaneous polls was perceived by the framers of the Constitution and therefore it cannot be unconstitutional. Kovind also said an \"implementation committee\" will look into the various constitutional amendments required to implement the concept, and it would then be up to parliament to take a final call. Delivering the Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial Lecture here, he said that the first four Lok Sabha and assembly polls were held together till 1967, then how could synchronised polls be dubbed as unconstitutional. Some sections are saying that the idea is unconstitutional, but it is not true as the concept was perceived by the makers of the Constitution, he said, adding that several institutions, including the Election Commission, have supported the concept in the past. In fact, he said, simultaneous polls would further strengthen federalism as all three tiers of governments will function together for five years. The former president also said that 'one nation, one election' is a popular catchphrase which has been misinterpreted by some, and a narrative has crept in that only one poll will take place under it with no further elections. He then explained that the concept is to hold elections to Lok Sabha, state assemblies and local bodies -- municipalities and panchayats -- together so that all the three tiers of governance get elected at he same time and work together for five years. The former president said 47 political parties gave representations to the high-level committee he headed and 32 of them supported holding polls simultaneously. Fifteen parties opposed the concept but they have supported the idea of simultaneous polls at one point or the other in the past, he observed. Addressing the audience, the former president recalled that the first four polls till 1967 were synchronised but the cycle was broken due to early dissolution of some state assemblies after he Centre used its constitutional powers under Article 356. \"Was it done in the right democratic spirit,\" he wondered, without delving into the issue further. He said that frequent elections disrupt development work and multiple cycles of campaigning trigger use of unaccounted money which hurts the integrity of the electoral process. Kovind also noted that frequent elections have also not found to be good for ease of doing business, trade and commerce. The Union Cabinet had recently approved the proposal for 'one nation, one election' as recommended by the Kovind panel. The panel had submitted the report in March ahead of the announcement of Lok Sabha elections. The high-level committee had recommended simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies as the first step followed by synchronised local body polls within 100 days. The panel had also proposed setting up of an 'Implementation Group' to look into the execution of the recommendations made by the committee.",

      "content": "New Delhi, Oct 5 (PTI) Several exit polls on Saturday predicted a clear majority for the Congress in Haryana and gave an edge to its alliance with the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir, with the regional partner emerging as the single largest party. 'Dainik Bhaskar' predicted the Congress getting 44-54 seats and the BJP 15-29 seats in the 90-member Haryana Assembly. The C-Voter-India Today polls gave Congress 50-58 seats and the BJP 20-28 seats in Haryana, while the Republic Bharat-Matrize polls put the Congress tally even higher at 55-62 seats as against the BJP's 18-24. The Red Mike-Datansh exit poll gave the Congress 50-55 seats in Haryana and the BJP at 20-25, while Dhruv Research pegged the Congress at 50-64 and the BJP at 22-32. Peoples' Pulse exit poll gave the Congress 49-60 seats and the BJP 20-32 seats in Haryana. Most exit polls pegged the INLD's tally higher than that of the JJP, while others were seen getting up to 10 seats. The BJP has been in power in Haryana since 2014 with Manohar Lal Khattar as chief minister for over nine years. The BJP's second term in office in 2019 was in alliance with the JJP, with Dushyant Singh Chautala as deputy chief minister. Khattar and Chautala quit in March ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, making way for Nayab Singh Saini, a prominent OBC face of the BJP, as chief minister. Chautala's JJP also snapped ties with the BJP. The Congress is hoping to make a comeback in Haryana with former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda leading the poll campaign. In Jammu and Kashmir, the C-Voter-India Today survey put the National Conference-Congress alliance at 40-48 seats and the BJP at 27-32 seats in the 90-member assembly of the Union Territory. Elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir after a gap of 10 years and the bifurcation of the state into two union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh -- in 2019. Dainik Bhaskar pegged the National Conference (NC)-Congress alliance at 35-40 and the BJP at 20-25 in Jammu and Kashmir, while Axis My India polls gave NC-Congress between 35 and 45 seats, the BJP in the range of 24-34 and others 4-10 seats. Peoples' Pulse saw the NC-Congress alliance getting 46-50 seats as against the BJP's 23-27, while Republic-Gulistan put the NC-Congress tally at 31-36 as against the BJP's 28-30. In different polls, the PDP was seen winning between five and 12 seats, while others were also seen bagging four-16 seats. The results of the assembly elections will be announced on October 8.",

      "content": "Bhubaneswar, Oct 5 (PTI) The Odisha government on Saturday recruited 16,009 junior teachers in primary and upper primary schools under various schemes. Chief Minister Mohan Majhi handed over some of the appointment letters during a function at Kalinga Stadium here in the presence of Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. The teachers were appointed in all the 30 districts of the state. “Teaching is the most respectful profession and teachers shape the future of society,” Majhi said, addressing the gathering. “In ancient times, gurus (teachers) were compared to Lords like Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswar,” he said. The chief minister also said his government has substantially raised the budgetary allocation for education. “Fulfilling promises at double speed! Appointment letters to more than 16,000 newly-inducted teachers was handed over today for strengthening the school education landscape. “This large-scale recruitment is a massive step towards improving quality of education, ensuring better learning outcomes and securing a bright future for Odisha’s children. CM Shri @MohanMOdisha ’s govt under the guidance of Hon’ble PM Shri @narendramodi is working 24x7 to realise aspirations, fulfil poll promises and achieve the goal of Viksit Odisha by 2036,” Pradhan said in post on X. The opposition BJD, however, mocked the BJP for taking credit for teachers’ recruitment. “The previous BJD government had completed the entire recruitment process. The BJP has no role in it, but takes credit just by distributing appointment letters,” the regional party said in a release.",

      "content": "Islamabad, Oct 5 (PTI) The Islamabad High Court on Saturday directed the Pakistan government to stop any unlawful protest in the capital during the SCO summit duration and allocate a designated place to the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan’s party for demonstration. Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for more than a year, has given a call for the rally. The PTI is demanding Khan's release, independence of the judiciary, and fighting against rising inflation. Earlier in the day amid rising tensions, authorities called in the Army here and at Lahore to prevent protest rallies by Khan’s supporters. The army would remain in Islamabad from October 5-17 to maintain law and order for the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, officials said. Pakistan is hosting the SCO summit on October 15-16. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq issued the order after hearing a petition by Traders’ Welfare Association president Raja Hassan Akhtar against protests by PTI supporters here. Justice Farooq said that the Ministry of Interior and the Islamabad administration were responsible for the maintenance of peace and law and order in the capital. However, such activities “are subject to reasonable and proportional restrictions in accordance with the law. Such restrictions are only justifiable through a legitimate purpose which must be in the best interest of the larger public,” the order read. The high court also stated that “no unlawful assembly shall be allowed to be held in Islamabad Capital Territory keeping in view the provisions of Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act, 2024.” CJ Farooq directed the authorities to take reasonable and proportional measures to ensure safety and public order in Islamabad and also asked the administration to allocate a designated place to the PTI for any political activity.",

      "description": "Congolese authorities on Saturday began vaccination against mpox, nearly two months after the disease outbreak that spread from Congo to several African countries and beyond was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization.",
      "content": "The Democratic Republic of Congo launched a vaccination campaign against the mpox on Saturday in the eastern city of Goma. The 265,000 doses donated to Congo by the European Union and the US were rolled out in the eastern city of Goma in North Kivu province, where hospitals and health workers have been overstretched, struggling to contain the new and possibly more infectious strain of mpox. Congo, with about 30,000 suspected mpox cases and 859 deaths, accounts for more than 80% of all the cases and 99% of all the deaths reported in Africa this year. All of the Central African nation’s 26 provinces have recorded mpox cases. The first vaccines were administered to hospital staff, with the program due to target the general population from Monday in the east of the country, where the current outbreak started a year ago. “As a doctor, I’m on the front line and in constant contact with those who are sick... I want to protect myself,” the first to be vaccinated, Jeannine Muhavi, told journalists. Local health officials and NGO workers had set up large tents to administer the vaccines, unfurling banners with the message: “mpox exists.” The DRC has so far received 265,000 vaccine doses, including donations from the United States and European Union. But it is still waiting for millions more promised doses to arrive from France, Japan and the United States. Since the start of the year, the country, one of the world’s poorest, has recorded more than 30,000 mpox cases, with 988 deaths, according to Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba. Seventy percent of the deaths have been children under five. “It will not be a mass vaccination campaign... the strategy is to vaccinate people most at risk,” Kamba told a press conference Friday in the capital, Kinshasa. “As you can imagine, in a country of 100 million people, we’re not going to solve the problem with 265,000 doses.” He said the aim was to target priority groups, such as those with existing health conditions and medical workers. The DRC’s current vaccine doses, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, are only intended for adults. The DRC has been in talks to secure further supplies from Japan, where another mpox vaccine has been approved for use on both adults and children. Japan has promised to send three million doses, Kamba said. President Joe Biden said last month the United States plans to donate one million doses of the mpox vaccine to African nations. “We are ready to commit $500 million to help African countries prevent and respond to mpox and to donate one million doses of mpox vaccine, now,” he told the UN General Assembly in New York. The World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday it had approved the use of the first diagnostic test for mpox. The test allows for the detection of the virus from swabs taken from human lesions. Kamba said the WHO had pledged around 4,500 tests for the DRC, but did not give an arrival date. Scientists discovered the disease, formerly called monkeypox, in 1958 in Denmark among monkeys kept for research. It was first spotted in humans in 1970 in what is now the DRC. The disease can cause painful rashes, fever, aches and lethargy, and in some cases can be deadly. Mpox has been detected in 16 African countries so far this year, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). The virus gained international prominence in May 2022, when a strain known as clade 2b spread around the world, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men. In July 2022, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, its highest level of alarm. The virus is currently circulating in 16 African countries, according to Africa CDC.

There were several dozen well-aged finds. There was also an unopened bottle of tremendous sentimental significance. In the early 1970s, when Ward’s children were young, they squashed the grapes that were eventually bottled.

Activate your Online Access Now Article content “It had a custom label, bottled by him on this date,” said Ward’s granddaughter, Claire Grenier. It was too much, though, to ask for the 50-year-old home-made wine to be magnificent. “It was not drinkable,” Grenier said. “It did not age well.” Ward, on the other hand, did. The Ottawa Citizen’s wine columnist from 1973 to 2002 died in his Kensington Avenue home on Sept. 15. He was 93. When the Ward’s Wines column ended, reader Mary Bullock lamented: “It was sad day for wine lovers. “Mr. Ward was a very generous person with his time and even with his own personal wine collection,” she wrote. “Mr. Ward was always available to answer personal questions and give advice on wine and he nurtured an appreciation of wine among his readers.” A year after Ward ended his column, he published his book Don’t Spit the Good Stuff. But Ward, a veteran journalist who was born in Toronto, would later say that his greatest accomplishment was helping to save the HMCS Haida, the famous Second World War warship that is now a National Historic Site in Hamilton, Ont. In 1964, when Ward was a reporter for the Toronto Telegram, he cornered then-Prince Philip during a Royal Tour that visited Quebec City and asked the Duke of Edinburgh if he would become the patron of the Haida, which was destined to be scrapped.

Article content Then, Ward was one of five men who bought the warship for $20,000, hoping to preserve it. To pay his share, Ward had mortgaged his house. Prince Philip was amenable, and his support helped Ward’s group succeed in rescuing the destroyer, which in 2018 was named the ceremonial flagship of the Royal Canadian Navy. Ward had personal reasons to save the Haida. In 1944, when Ward was scarcely in his teen years, his father, Leslie, was one of 128 people who died aboard HMCS Athabaskan when it was sunk by the Germans off France’s Breton coast. It was the Haida that rescued many of the Athabaskan’s survivors. Ward also became a naval reservist. At the age of 21, Ward began working at the Toronto Telegram. He rose from covering the notorious Toronto bank robber Alonzo Boyd to reporting from Fidel Castro’s Cuba and war-torn Vietnam. Eventually, he was assigned to the Parliamentary Press Gallery in Ottawa. When the Telegram folded in 1971, Ward struck out on his own as a freelancer. Ward News Services reported on Canadian politics for news outlets around the world, and in the mid-1970s, Ward hosted the CBC Radio show Capital Report.

Article content By then, he had already begun writing about wine for the Citizen, hired by the newspaper’s then-entertainment editor Noel Taylor. “I knew diddly-squeak about wine,” Ward told this newspaper in 2002. “Sure, I made wine in the basement and I liked to drink the stuff, but that was about it. But Noel said he wanted somebody who could write well and wasn’t afraid to learn in public. So, there I was.” Over the years, Ward documented the rise of the wine industry in North America. When his column debuted, the Ontario Liquor Control Board operated stores where consumers had to fill out chits and pass them across a counter to a clerk who would fetch bottles, sometimes of dubious quality, and wrap them in plain paper. In 2002, Michael Mondavi, chairman of Robert Mondavi Winery in Napa Valley, told this newspaper that Ward “watched California emerge as a premier wine-growing region. We salute his passion for wine and wonderful ability in communicating it to others.” Peter Ward, testing port at the LCBO in 2000. Photo by Lynn Ball / Ottawa Citizen Ward was a huge fan of Canadian wineries and said his biggest thrill as a wine writer was being able to watch the evolution and maturing of Canadian wines.

Article content “In the early 1970s, Ontario wines were awful,” Ward said in 2002. “They were either sickly sweet or they had this horrible concord grape taste... But now we’re producing world-class, award-winning wines.” Meanwhile, Ottawa had become a bright spot for wine appreciation in Canada, Ward said, in part because military personnel and diplomats posted abroad returned home with a taste for good wine. Ward’s passion for wine led him to travel widely, to wineries in Italy, California, Spain, France, Portugal, Chile, South Africa, Germany, Georgia, Iran and Tunisia. On Facebook, Sandor Johnson, proprietor and winemaker of Potter Settlement Artisan Wines in Tweed, wrote late last month that Ward had given him a 6,000-year-old wine amphora that he had procured in Cyprus. “Together we used dental picks to scrape out the 6000-year-old wine residue. We got it to re-ferment to make us a vintage that tastes incredible, which someday we will debut at our winery,” Johnson wrote. “Not a lot of 93-year-old guys out there as fun as my friend.” Peter Ward, drinking wine using a special decanter, in 2001. Photo by Wayne Hiebert / The Ottawa Citizen In Ottawa, Ward was a fixture in Westboro, said his granddaughter. He and his wife Jane, who died in 2015, hosted neighbours on their patio for drinks every day before dinner. “They created quite a community on the street,” Grenier said.

Randy Fitzpatrick, the owner of Petit Bill’s Bistro, said Ward had his last lunch of fish and chips there last month. Fitzpatrick, who took Algonquin College’s sommelier program in 2004, said he met Ward at that time. “He was just a fine gentlemen. I was happy enough to consider him a friend,” Fitzpatrick said. Grenier said her grandfather “survived a lot. He had throat cancer, was diagnosed as diabetic since 1975 and lasted much longer than he thought he would, than we thought he would. “He was an interesting, bold and brilliant man with a great life,” Grenier said. “He was getting to a point where he could pass on and see the next thing.” In addition to Grenier, Ward is survived by his three children and three other grandchildren. phum@postmedia.com Recommended from Editorial Obituary: Food writer Kathleen Walker was the 'Duchess' of the Ottawa Citizen newsroom Obituary: Gay Cook (1930-2024) championed Ottawa's culinary community through her columns Article content Share this article in your social network Share this Story : Obituary: Ottawa Citizen wine writer Peter Ward championed great bottles Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Comments You must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.

      "description": "A builder is constantly stopped for selfies due to his uncanny resemblance to a Hollywood megastar. He says he's mistaken for the actor \"almost every day\"",
      "content": "A builder who looks just like Hugh Grant says he’s constantly approached by strangers in the street, shops and restaurants for a selfie. Nigel Lambert is the spitting image of the famous actor. The 50-year-old says the likeness causes strangers to stop him in the street and ask for photos. He says his face usually turns red and he quickly reveals that he’s just a lookalike. The dad-of-four only noticed similarities when he got into his forties. “I do get mistaken for him. It’s constant. It’s everywhere I go,” Nigel, from Port Talbot, south Wales, said. “Almost every day someone will stop me and ask for a photo. My face goes red and I tell them I’m not him. “When I’m working, customers will point it out. If I take my wife to a restaurant, people come over and say ‘you look just like Hugh Grant’. “One guy in a restaurant asked me for a photo to send to his wife. It happens in the supermarket, the street, restaurants. “I can see people looking and thinking ‘is that him?’.” Nigel says it isn’t just his looks that make him resemble the actor as he’s also a “gentleman”. Nigel said: “I’m a gentleman. I hold doors open for people, women and men. I’m nice to everyone. “Once I was coming out of a shop and I helped a lady who was struggling with her trolley. I pulled it for her and put her bags in the car and she said ‘you do look like him, I can see what they’re talking about’. “I didn’t know this woman so I assumed she’d been discussing it with someone. I just go along with it.” Wife Leah, 47, is a fan of the star and Nigel says she has “no complaints” about her husband being 64-year-old Notting Hill actor Hugh’s doppelganger. Nigel added: “I’m flattered by it. We like Hugh Grant and we like his films. We like Notting Hill. “I hope my wife thinks he’s a handsome guy. She isn’t complaining though. I only noticed it when I got into my forties. I’m not sure what’s changed about me. My hair got longer and my face started changing.”",

The terrorist group was targeted in the vicinity of Bida Isse and Geriile under the newly liberated town of Eeldheer in Galmudug. Defense Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur told a press conference in the capital Mogadishu that current operations involve both ground and air strikes aimed at dismantling the militant group’s infrastructure. “At the national level, the SNA is conducting targeted missions to further weaken Al-Shabaab’s strongholds and leadership,” he said. On the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, he said next year, a new operation “will be launched to replace ATMIS, and Ethiopian forces will not participate unless they withdraw their false agreements.” He also hailed the launch of Türkiye's seismic research vessel Oruc Reis to Somalia, saying the move is part of implementation of a defense and economic pact between Somalia and Türkiye signed earlier this year.",

      "description": "Barron Trump, the only child of Melania Trump with former US President Donald Trump, became the victim of the cruel viral video released in November 2016.",
      "content": "Barron Trump , the only child of Melania Trump with former US President Donald Trump, became the victim of the cruel viral video released in November 2016. As the former First Lady has been active on social media ahead of the release of her upcoming memoir on October 8, she broke silence on how her son was bullied in person and online due to Rosie O’Donnell. According to Daily Beast, which has gone through the copy of her 184-page book, reported that Melania has addressed the persistent rumors that Trump's youngest children may be suffering from autism. In her book Melania, the former First Lady has targetted her husband's detractors, which also rehashes several issues that have surrounded them since Trump's candidacy in 2015. However, the O'Donnell section might be the most scathing about one of the couple's alleged rivals and the most insightful about her 18-year-old son, whose privacy has been carefully protected by his mother so far. The argument with O'Donnell began when Barron , who is now 18 years old, was featured in a cruel viral video that went viral in November 2016. The video claimed to show signs of autism spectrum disorder in Barron's behavior, such as not clapping his hands together after his father's speech at the Republican National Convention. The comedian and ex-co-host of The View shared the video on Twitter, now X, expressing sympathy for Trump's youngest son, calling it an “opportunity to bring attention” to what she referred to as “the autism epidemic.” Melania hits back at Rosie O'Donnell Rejecting the false claims of Barron being autistic, Melania has admitted in her book that she “was appalled by such cruelty.” “It was clear to me that she was not interested in raising awareness about autism. I felt that she was attacking my son because she didn’t like my husband,” Trump's third wife writes as she claps back at O'Donnell. She makes it apparent that she had seen the entire video, which was later removed by the individual who posted it. She mentions that “Someone had painstakingly compiled the footage and added captions like, 'His hands are moving erratically and aren't touching each other. Then he was spotted making strange movements in his seat, typical of children with autism'.” Also Read : Barron Trump reveals his ‘embarrassing’ nickname that Melania gave him Melania further clarifies that Barron behaved appropriately according to his age since he was just ten years old during 2016 RNC in Cleveland. “There is nothing shameful about autism (though O’Donnell’s tweet implied that there was), but Barron is not autistic,” she states. She describes O'Donnell's actions as “devastating as a parent” and charges her of “sheer malice.” Barron's mom also admits that she felt like her heart was shattering into a million of pieces. Shortly after Melania hired an experienced lawyer to take on the original poster of the video, O'Donnell deleted her tweet and issued an apology, claiming that one of her daughters was on the spectrum of autism. Sharing experience of Barron being bullied both in person and online after the incident, she called it a “clear indication of the irreparable damage caused.” Melania's book is all set to hit the shelves ahead of November 5 elections.",

      "description": "Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher is splashing out on a pool at his £4million North London mansion but there's one big issue in his way...he doesn't know how to swim",
      "content": "Oasis star Liam Gallagher is splashing out a fortune for a pool at his house but he can’t swim. The rock and roll legend had just been granted planning permission to create the leisure suite at his north London mansion. But the frontman might need to take a few lessons so he can properly enjoy ploughing up and down his 24ft pool. He confessed to not being able to master the water while chatting with mum Peggy – a keen swimmer – and son Gene on Celebrity Gogglebox. And brothers Noel and Paul were in the same non-swimming boat. Liam told Peggy: “You are the only one out of us lot that can swim. Me, Noel and Paul can’t swim.” Gene added: “You can swim. I’ve seen you. It’s just that you can’t get your head up. You just go underwater.” And Liam added: “I can do half a width. I wish I could swim. I struggle when it goes deeper and that. That’s when I start flapping around like some mad salmon, like a crazy salmon and I’ve got to go back. I struggle having a shower.” Peggy revealed she was a regular visitor to her local pool and said she did 20 widths at a time. He told his mum of her love of swimming: “Good for you. That’s grand. I’m jealous, man.” Liam had plans for his new swimming pool approved at his £4million home despite his neighbours trying to block the build. The singer, 51, upset local residents after seeking permission to install a pool, plus high-security wall and gates, at his home in well-healed Highgate. The Highgate Society complained the rocker’s application would “create a most unfortunate precedent” and claimed they could be “seriously affected by any ground water diversion”. But now the Britpop legend was granted planning permission to install the new pool by Haringey Council. Liam has been given the green light to go ahead with the garden project, which will also include a patio, pool plant and air source heat pump. The singer’s roughly 24ft by 12ft swimming pool will come with a cover system and feature “bullnosed edge” detail, with “buff natural stone steps”, according to plans submitted to the council. .",

      "content": "Brit soldiers are training for combat against Terminator-style robotic droids capable of “Hasta la Vista, baby” style speech and movement. The new AI-capable SimStriker droids fitted with ChatGPT software are capable of goading troops into making rash decisions with chatter reminiscent of Arnold Schwarzenegger infamous T-800 robotic assassin from the iconic Terminator film franchise. The futuristic “I’ll be back” devices are designed to “take the quality or urban combat training to new heights for soldiers”. Trials of a new generation of the intelligent robotic targets are set to begin in just a few weeks at the 16 Air Assault Brigade Combat Team’s dedicated urban fighting facility in Colchester, Essex. Major Shaun Clarke told boffins at Soldier magazine the new SimStriker droids come with ChapGPT software enabling them to talk to troops and react according to how their human opponents speak and move. He said: “This is a vital evolution in low-level tactical training. “We are now focusing on skills that demand more reactive targetry, and SimStriker captures data that allows us to continuously improve our training. “As a 3D, data-enabled and AI-driven target, it gives us – for the first time – the ability to train against a thinking enemy and immediately conduct a hot debrief based on accurate data before we go again.” Makers say SimStriker’s reactions can be influenced by the conversation itself – the soldier can calm the situation by using placatory language or inflame it by using aggressive phraseology. The tech also allows for third parties, such as instructors, to alter the droid’s “mood” and how it will react in any given situation. Just like in the Terminator series when the sci-fi baddie uses language such as ““I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle” and “You’re terminated” to terrify opponents and “Come with me if you want to live” to win the trust of others. James Crowley from manufacturer 4GD, added: “Utilising AI means troops will be able to have exchanges with the device that replicate scenarios they are likely to face in combat zones.” The Terminator-style robot has been in use at Colchester without the new AI component for more than three years. The device drops down onto its base when engaged, can detect precision and rate of fire plus movement, light and sound. It can also raise an alarm and shoot back with non-lethal ammunition from an air soft weapon located in its abdomen.",

      "content": "ISTANBUL Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday accused Israel of using regional conflicts as pretexts to justify its escalating \"occupation and expansion.\" “Yemen, Syria, and Iran are merely excuses,” said Erdogan. “The Israeli government produces new justifications daily to legitimize its occupation and invasion policies,” he added, speaking at a ruling party event in Istanbul. Erdogan said Western nations are ignoring Israel's actions due to guilt over the Holocaust. He called on Israel’s unconditional supporters to act \"rationally\" and stop enabling its actions. Erdogan also underlined the Palestinian resistance to Israel’s treatment of Palestinians since last Oct. 7, nearly a year ago, when Israeli’s deadly offensive on Gaza began. “Our brothers in Gaza have been resisting Zionist occupiers heroically for 364 days despite all hardships,” he said. Stressing Türkiye’s stance, Erdogan said Ankara will continue to support Gaza with all possible means. “We stand firmly in the same place today as we stood on the first day. We defend the same values today that we defended on the first day,” he said. Türkiye never hesitates to say the same things at the podium of the UN as it tells the domestic public, Erdogan added. ​Türkiye is the only state to impose economic sanctions on Israel, he said.​​​​​​​",

      "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — Military officials and analysts in the United States have for years warned of possible Chinese armed attacks or blockades on Taiwan, but a report released on Friday has raised a red flag about possible nonmilitary tactics that could be used effectively against the self-governed island.Beijing could wage an economic and cyber war to force Taiwan to surrender without directly using military power, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington, D.C.-based research institute, said in the report. Such a likely but overlooked scenario, it added, poses a challenge for the US, the island's biggest ally, and suggested that Washington make preparations for how best to respond.FDD researchers teamed up with banking and finance experts in Taiwan over two days earlier this year to simulate likely nonmilitary moves by Beijing, such as disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks on infrastructure. The exercise was the first of its kind and seeks to fill an analytical gap, the FDD said.\"Modern globalization has created more economic connections that China can exploit to achieve coercive aims,\" the report said. \"Technological innovation created even more digital connections, offering more possibilities for coercion, including through the targeting of critical infrastructure.\"Beijing has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary, although Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to make \"utmost efforts\" to do so peacefully. Taiwan split from the mainland in 1949 during a civil war when the defeated nationalist government fled to the island.Tensions have flared in the Taiwan Strait since 2016, when Beijing began to increase diplomatic and military pressure on the island, prompting the US to step up its support. Washington, which is obligated under US law to provide Taipei with sufficient military hardware for its defense, has argued that it is in America's interest to keep peace in the strait and to stand with democracies such as Taiwan to maintain the rules-based world order.Beijing has demanded the US to stay out of Taiwan, arguing it is a purely domestic affair.US President Joe Biden has indicated he would send troops to defend Taiwan in case of an armed attack by China, but the US government is yet to formulate a plan to respond to nonmilitary tactics, giving Beijing flexibility in working to undermine Taiwan without triggering an outright response from Washington that a military invasion would, the FDD researchers said.Taiwan's Foreign and Defense ministries had no immediate comment on the report.With an estimated 1 million Taiwanese living and working in China, economic ties have grown ever closer. That has made the possibility of economic coercion, boycotts and military blockades an even bigger threat.In the simulation exercises, the experts from the US and Taiwan studied possible moves by Beijing, such as conducting psychological wars to erode public trust, banning imports of Taiwanese products or raising tariffs on them, short-selling Taiwanese stocks, freezing bank transfers across the strait, cutting fiber optic cables, and targeting energy imports and storage.Recommendations include that Taiwan diversify its energy imports, relocate businesses away from the mainland, develop new markets, and build alliances and partnerships. The report suggested the US develop a playbook of options to counter China and improve coordination with allies.The Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance, which worked with the FDD on the simulation exercises, has argued that Taiwan must strengthen its financial resilience.\"China could destabilize Taiwan's financial system to incite social unrest as a precursor to invasion,\" the report said.Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Washington-based Global Taiwan Institute, said Beijing had already been ramping up nonmilitary measures against Taipei and that such efforts were expected to intensify in the coming months and years.\"It behooves the United States and Taiwan to work with allies and like-minded partners to strengthen our collective resilience to China's weaponization of economic interdependence,\" he said.

      "content": "Dhaka, Oct 5: Nearly 300 people, mostly rural farmers, have been killed in lightning strikes in Bangladesh this year. A total of 297 people, including 242 men and 55 women, died due to lightning strikes during the period from February to September this year, Xinhua news agency reported. Save the Society and Thunderstorm Awareness Forum (SSTF), a local organisation, published the death toll at a press conference in Dhaka on Saturday. The SSTF, which has been monitoring casualties from thunderstorms since 2019, said 73 people were injured during this period. The majority of lightning fatalities occurred in rural areas where people were working on their farmlands, it said. SSTF said the figures for lightning casualties were collected from national dailies, local daily newspapers, online news portals, and television channels. Bangladesh’s Interim Leader Seeks Malaysia’s Support for Repatriation of Rohingya Refugees. More than 96 deaths were reported in May, along with 77 in June, 19 in July, 17 in August and 47 in September. Deaths due to lightning strikes are common in Bangladesh in the months when the weather changes from the dry season to the rainy summer season. But the South Asian country has seen a surge in deaths due to lightning strikes over recent years, and some of the country's experts have blamed the situation directly on climate change. The number of deaths caused by lightning strikes has been rising in recent years in Bangladesh, fueled by climate change. The country records an average of 300 deaths by lightning strikes every year compared to fewer than 20 annually in the US, which has almost double the population, according to the UN. The majority of victims of lightning are farmers, who are vulnerable to the elements as they work the fields through the rainy monsoon months in the spring and summer.

According to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief and the non-governmental organisation Disaster Forum, at least 3,162 people were killed by lightning strikes from 2011 to 2021. Bangladesh declared lightning strikes a natural disaster in 2016 after more than 200 people were killed in May that year. (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Oct 05, 2024 09:43 PM IST.

      "content": "Chennai, Oct 5 (PTI) The Tamil Nadu government is likely to intervene in resolving the Samsung India Electronics Limited workers' strike, which has been continuing since September 9, a senior state government official said on Saturday. At least 1,100 workers are on strike out of the total 1,750 employees. Chief Minister M K Stalin has instructed three state ministers to hold parleys with the striking workers of Samsung home appliances manufacturing unit in Sriperumbudur near here, and resolve the crisis soon, the official said. The Ministerial team comprising T R B Rajaa (Industries), T M Anbarasan (MSME), and C V Ganesan (Labour Welfare and Skill Development), is likely to hold talks on Monday and ensure an early end to the agitation. Scores of members of Left parties including their state leaders were detained here on Saturday when they held a demonstration without obtaining permission from the police, to express solidarity with the workers whose protest entered the 27th day on October 5. Communist Party of India state secretary R Mutharasan and CPI (M) state secretary K Balakrishnan who were among those detained by the police, sought the immediate intervention of the Chief Minister to end the strike. They stressed that the protesting workers had a right to join a union and alleged that the workers were being oppressed against exercising such a right. A senior police official said protesters were detained at a marriage hall in Nungambakkam and were later released. Balakrishnan asked whether their arrest was aimed at 'not upsetting' the Samsung management. Mutharasan said the Constitution allowed peaceful protests. \"Also, the question is: do we have the right to form a union or not?\" Mutharasan, asked. Meanwhile, the company said it was committed to resolving the issues including wages, benefits, and working conditions by negotiating with the workers directly. The production at the factory which was impacted earlier due to the strike, has been normalised and the Korean electronic giant 'ensured' that there was no disruption ahead of the festive season. \"At Samsung India, the welfare of our employees is our top priority. We want to reiterate that we comply with all laws and regulations of the country,\" the company spokesperson said. The average monthly salary of the full-time manufacturing workers at the Chennai plant is 1.8 times the average salary of similar workers employed at other companies in the region. \"Our workers are also eligible for overtime pay and other allowances and we provide a workplace environment that assures the highest standards of health, safety and welfare, including free shuttle bus and meals,\" the spokesperson told PTI in response to the strike. Observing that the workforce has served the company for more than 10 years, the spokesperson said the company derived satisfaction in seeing the workers putting in many years of service. The spokesperson also clarified that the striking workers would not be paid for the duration of the illegal strike in accordance with the 'No Work, No Pay' policy. \"We are committed to resolving all issues including wages, benefits and working conditions by negotiating with our workers directly. As of now, we have been able to normalise production at our Chennai factory. We have ensured that there is no disruption to our consumers ahead of the festive season. We again urge the striking workers to return to work,\" the spokesperson added.",

Whatever the exit polls show, our belief is that the vote was for change, for keeping the BJP out in both regions (Kashmir and Jammu),\" Mir told PTI Videos here. He asserted the Congress-NC alliance would get more than 55 seats when the results are announced. Polling in Jammu and Kashmir was held for 90 seats. According to reports, the lieutenant governor will nominate five members to the Assembly based on the Home Ministry's advice. Mir said the Congress-NC tie-up is the \"only viable alliance\" between a national party and a regional outfit in Jammu and Kashmir that will \"take the people out of their miseries\". To a question about the exit poll results for Haryana, the Congress leader said it reflects people's anger towards the BJP government in the state and asserted that his party would get more seats than what the exit polls predicted. \"The BJP's 10-year rule in Haryana was bad. They annoyed the farmers, youth and the unemployed. So six months before the elections, there was a wave to end BJP rule there. That is what the exit polls are showing. It is our belief that the Congress will get more seats than what the exit polls are showing,\" Mir added.",

      "content": "Guwahati, Oct 5 (PTI) Ten people were arrested from Assam in the nationwide crackdown on terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) on Saturday, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. In the massive pan-India crackdown, NIA conducted searches at 26 locations across five states -- Assam, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir \"Today, Assam Police led by NIA has arrested 10 members of an Islamic terrorist organisation,\" he posted on X. Attacking the Congress, he alleged that whenever there is a threat to Assam, the opposition party opposes the government, protecting \"this ecosystem\". A senior police officer said that in a joint operation conducted by the NIA and Assam Police, nine suspects were apprehended from Goalpara and one from Hojai district. \"All those arrested are currently in NIA custody. An investigation and legal procedures are currently ongoing,\" he said. Speaking on the sidelines of a programme, Sarma said these arrests have once again proved that the threat to Assam from \"radical elements\" was very much real. \"A section of people is often derisive when I mention these threats but it has been proved time and again what we are saying is true,\" he said, adding that whenever NIA acts against radical elements, arrests will be made from Assam. \"In Assam, it is a fact that radical forces have infiltrated and it is necessary for us to be cautious,\" he said. Sarma alleged that slogans raised by encroachers during the eviction drive at Kachutoli in Kamrup (Metropolitan) district prove that \"a form of radical training\" was being imparted. \"The arrests made in Goalpara and the Kochutoli incident indicate that the indigenous people of the state will have to lead a life of deep uncertainty in the next 10-15 years. It will be very difficult for us to live here if this continues,\" he claimed. Two persons were killed in police firing following violence during the recent eviction drive in Kochutoli village.",

      "description": "BANGKOK — Chiang Mai, a city in northern Thailand that is popular with tourists, was flooded on Saturday as its main river overflowed its banks following heavy seasonal rainfall.Authorities ordered some evacuations and said they were working to pump water out of residential areas and clear obstructions from waterways and drains to help the floodwater recede faster.Dozens of shelters were set up across the city to accommodate residents whose homes were inundated. The Chiang Mai government said the water level of the Ping River, which runs along the eastern edge of the city, was at critically high levels and had been rising since Friday.However, the provincial irrigation office forecast on Saturday that the water level is likely to remain stable and return to normal in about five days.Thai media reported that efforts to evacuate elephants and other animals from several sanctuaries and parks on the outskirts of the city continued on Saturday. About 125 elephants, along with other animals, were taken to safety from the Elephant Nature Park, from where some escaped on their own to seek higher ground. About 10 animal shelters in the area have been flooded.Chiang Mai Gov. Nirat Pongsitthavorn said the latest flooding — the second in six weeks — exceeded expectations.Thailand's state railway suspended service to Chiang Mai, with trains on the northern line from the capital Bangkok terminating at Lampang, about an hour-and-a-half hours ride to the south. Chiang Mai International Airport said it was operating as usual on Saturday.Flooding was reported in 20 Thai provinces on Saturday, mostly in the north. At least 49 people have died and 28 were injured in floods since August, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said.In Bangkok, the government said on Saturday it would let more water flow out of the Chao Phraya Dam in central Chai Nat province over the next seven days, as it risks exceeding its capacity. The release of the water may affect residents downstream who live near waterways in Thailand's central region, including the capital and surrounding areas.",

      "description": "DHAKA — Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus on Friday sought Malaysia's help in engaging the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) on raising the issue of repatriating Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.Malaysia takes over the chairmanship of the 10-member regional bloc next year.The appeal came as visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim met with Yunus in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka — the first visit by a foreign leader to the South Asian country since the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize laureate took over on August 8 and the first state visit by a Malaysian leader in 11 years.Yunus took over after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh during a mass uprising that accused her of corruption, violation of human rights and excessive use of force against the protesters. He has pledged reforms and a push for reviving the country's troubled economy.Bangladesh has been hosting 1 million Rohingya refugees who fled the violence being committed against them by Myanmar's military. They live in destitute sprawling camps in Bangladesh and have long been demanding a safe return home.Yunus told a news conference after the two leaders held talks that he had asked for Anwar's help in raising the Rohingya repatriation issue at the Asean.\"Malaysia will be supporting us in raising that,\" the interim leader said. \"This is something we have to resolve as soon as possible.\"Yunus said they also discussed boosting bilateral trade and finalizing a free trade agreement between their Muslim-majority nations, as well as political cooperation, investment, and cultural and humanitarian ties.They stressed the need to explore new opportunities in sectors such as agriculture, energy, education, the semiconductor industry and connectivity.Along with involving the Asean in resolving the Rohingya refugee crisis, Bangladesh is also eager to increase trade with members of the bloc. Bangladesh was Malaysia's second-largest trading partner in South Asia in 2023, with total trade reaching $2.78 billion, official figures show.Malaysia is also one of the leading destinations for Bangladeshi migrant workers. About 800,000 Bangladeshi workers are employed as low-skilled employees in Malaysia's construction, manufacturing, plantation and services sectors.But the recruiting process is often corrupt, and allegations of rights violations by Malaysian employers and Bangladeshi recruiting agencies are rampant.Also, more than 6,000 Bangladeshi students study at Malaysian higher education institutions, 2023 figures show.The United News of Bangladesh agency reported that Anwar offered on Friday to recruit 18,000 more new Bangladeshi workers for his country, promising to also ensure decent working conditions for overseas workers.\"We need more workers, but they can't be treated as modern slaves,\" the agency quoted him as saying.Anwar arrived from Pakistan with a 58-member delegation for the hourslong visit to Bangladesh.",

      "description": "BEIRUT — Hezbollah said on Saturday its fighters were confronting Israeli troops in Lebanon's southern border region, where Israel's military said it struck militants from the Iran-backed movement at a mosque.Rapidly escalating violence in recent days saw intense Israeli strikes on Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon as ground troops conducted raids near the border, transforming nearly a year of cross-border exchanges into a full-blown war.In the first reported Israeli air strike on the northern Tripoli region in the current flare-up, Palestinian militant group Hamas said the \"Zionist bombardment\" of the Beddawi refugee camp killed a commander, Saeed Attallah Ali, as well as his wife and two daughters on Saturday.The escalation, which this week included Iran's second-ever missile attack on Israel, intensifying Hezbollah rocket fire and strikes claimed by Iran allies from as far away as Yemen, comes just days before the first anniversary of Hamas' attacks on southern Israel.In downtown Beirut, Ibrahim Nazzal, who is among hundreds of thousands displaced by the violence, said, \"We want the war to stop so we can go back to our land.\"\"All our homes are gone. I don't know what we will go back to,\" he added.Nearly a year into the war in the Gaza Strip triggered by Hamas' unprecedented attacks, Israel has shifted its focus north, aiming to allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by Hezbollah rocket fire to return home.Israel's military launched an intensified wave of strikes on Hezbollah strongholds around Lebanon, killing more than 1,110 people since September 23.On the ground, Hezbollah said early on Saturday its fighters were engaged in clashes with Israeli troops in the border area after earlier saying they had forced soldiers to retreat.The Israeli military said its forces had killed 250 Hezbollah fighters in the border area this week, and struck early on Saturday a militant \"command center located inside a mosque\" in the town of Bint Jbeil.Peacekeepers 'remain'Israel's recent attacks on Lebanon have killed an Iranian general, a host of Hezbollah commanders and, in the biggest blow to the group in decades, its leader Hassan Nasrallah.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a rare public address on Friday, said \"the resistance in the region will not back down with these martyrdoms,\" praising the \"fierce defense\" of Hezbollah and Hamas against Israeli forces.As Israel mulls its response to the Iranian missile attack on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden cautioned against striking Iranian oil facilities, a day after he said Washington was \"discussing\" such action.The Iranian attack, which Tehran called revenge for the killing of Nasrallah and other top figures, killed one person in the occupied West Bank.Satellite pictures of the Nevatim air base in southern Israel showed apparent damage to a structure on Wednesday, compared with a photo taken on August 3.In Lebanon, Israeli bombardment has put at least four hospitals out of service, and on Friday, the first delivery of medical aid organized by the United Nations reached Beirut's airport.Agence France-Presse (AFP) correspondents heard a series of explosions in south Beirut early on Saturday after the Israeli military's Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee warned residents to evacuate part of it.Lebanon said an Israeli strike on Friday cut off the main international road to Syria, with Israel saying it aimed to prevent the flow of weapons.Lebanon's disaster management unit said more than 374,000 people — most of them Syrian refugees — had sought refuge in Syria in the final week of September.The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon said its forces \"remain in all positions\" despite an Israeli request on Monday to \"relocate some of our positions\" as the military's ground incursions began.The UN Interim Force in Lebanon also urged commitment \"in actions, not just words\" to Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and stipulated that only the Lebanese army and peacekeepers should be deployed in southern Lebanon.",

In a statement, the group said it struck the “Atar military industries company near Sakhnin with a rocket barrage.” In other statements, Hezbollah claimed it fired rockets at the Ma'ale Golani military base in northern Israel. Israeli soldier positions in the woods of the Dan settlement in Upper Galilee, northern Israel, were also targeted with a large rocket barrage. The group also reported targeting the Sa'sa settlement in the Upper Galilee area of northern Israel with two Falaq-2 rockets and the Ramat David airbase with a volley of Fadi-1 rockets. Hezbollah also reported targeting an Israeli Merkava tank as it advanced near the Maroun Woods with a guided missile, claiming a direct hit that resulted in casualties among its crew. Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in cross-border warfare since the start of Israel's war on Gaza, which has killed over 41,800 people, most of them women and children, following an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas last October. At least 2,036 people have since been killed, over 9,500 injured, and 1.2 million others displaced, according to Lebanese authorities. The international community has warned that Israeli attacks in Lebanon could escalate the Gaza conflict into a wider regional war. *Writing by Mohammad Sio​​​​​​​",

      "description": "PORT-AU-PRINCE — Haiti's government has deployed specialist anti-gang police units, it said on Friday, after an apparent massacre northwest of Port-au-Prince that the United Nations said left at least 70 dead.Carried out early on Thursday in the town of Pont Sonde, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the Haitian capital, the attack saw scores of houses and vehicles torched after gang members opened fire.The killings come as an international policing mission, led by Kenyan forces, attempts to restore government control in Haiti, where armed gangs have seized swaths of the capital and countryside and earlier this year helped push out the country's leader.\"Members of the Gran Grif gang used automatic rifles to shoot at the population, killing at least 70 people, among them about 10 women and three infants,\" UN Human Rights Office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement on Friday.The Haitian prime minister's office said in a statement that \"this latest act of violence, targeting innocent civilians, is unacceptable and demands an urgent, rigorous and coordinated response from the state.\"The embattled Haitian National Police would be \"stepping up its efforts,\" the statement said, adding that \"agents from the Temporary Anti-Gang Unit (UTAG) have been deployed as reinforcements to back up teams already on the ground.\"A spokesman for a local civil society group told Haitian media that the attack came after Gran Grif leader Luckson Elan had issued threats against people refusing to pay the group tolls to use a nearby highway.\"They executed dozens of residents,\" Bertide Horace told radio station Magik 9. \"Almost all of the victims were shot in the head.\"\"Police officers stationed nearby, apparently understaffed, offered no resistance to the criminals, preferring to take cover,\" she said.At least 16 people were seriously injured, the UN said, including two gang members shot by police.The gang reportedly set fire to at least 45 houses and 34 vehicles, it added, forcing many residents to flee.Kenyan-led policing missionAdditional security forces, supported by the Kenyan-led international policing mission deployed to the country, were sent to Pont Sonde overnight on Thursday into Friday, the prime minister's office said.The attack occurred at 3 a.m. on Thursday.Prime Minister Garry Conille said the \"heinous crime, perpetrated against defenseless women, men and children, is not only an attack on these victims but [also] on the entire Haitian nation.\"Last week, the UN Human Rights Office said more than 3,600 people had been killed already this year in \"senseless\" gang violence in the country.Haiti has for years been beset by compounding political, humanitarian and gang crises, with armed groups rising up to push out then-prime minister Ariel Henry earlier this year in an effort that saw attacks on the international airport and police stations.Many politicians are intertwined with armed groups: last week, the US Treasury announced sanctions against a lawmaker from the Artibonite Department, where Pont Sonde is located, for allegedly helping form the Gran Grif gang to aid in his 2016 election.Unelected and unpopular — and unable to restore order — Henry resigned, and a transitional government with Conille as prime minister was put in place, backed by the international community.That government is mandated to restore security and lead the country to its first polls since 2016.",

      "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Joe Biden said on Friday he was not confident that the United States election in November would be peaceful, citing incendiary comments by Republican contender Donald Trump, who still refuses to accept his 2020 defeat.The US president's warning came with lawmakers and analysts voicing concern over the increasingly bellicose campaign language ahead of the vote.Trump — who survived an assassination bid in July and another apparent plot in September — alleged widespread fraud after his defeat to Biden, and pro-Trump rioters riled up by his false claims ransacked the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\"I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it would be peaceful,\" Biden told reporters as he discussed the election.\"The things that Trump has said and the things that he said last time out when he didn't like the outcome of the election were very dangerous,\" he said.Trump was impeached in 2021 for inciting the insurrection after hundreds of his supporters — exhorted by the defeated Republican to \"fight like hell\" — battered police as they smashed windows at the Capitol and broke through doors.'They cheat like hell'He has been indicted over what prosecutors allege was a \"private criminal effort\" to subvert the election that culminated in the violence.Trump — who was due to return to the venue of his first assassination bid in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday — has long been assailed over his violent rhetoric.Biden made his comments during what was the first appearance of his presidency in the White House briefing room, where he touted his administration's achievements as Vice President Kamala Harris battles Trump.Harris and Trump, meanwhile, were barnstorming the battleground states that are likely to decide who wins the White House race.Trump on Friday campaigned in North Carolina, where he reprised his claims of 2020 voter fraud: \"We should get elected, but remember this, they cheat like hell,\" he said.He also visited neighboring Georgia, a swing state narrowly claimed by Biden four years ago but won by Trump in 2016 — and one of the biggest prizes of the 2024 election map.The Republican inserted himself aggressively into Georgia politics after his 2020 defeat, pushing for state officials to \"find\" enough votes to overturn Biden's victory.Trump, 78, was charged by state prosecutors with racketeering, in a case that is on pause and expected to start up again after the election. He denies wrongdoing.'Biggest loser'Trump joined Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, after receiving a briefing on the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Helene, the deadliest storm to hit the US mainland since Katrina in 2005.Trump has repeatedly spread misinformation about the federal response to the disaster, falsely alleging that funding for relief has been misappropriated by Harris and redirected toward migrants.Harris, who is neck and neck with Trump in all seven swing states, rallied on Friday in Michigan, a union stronghold that epitomized the US manufacturing decline of the 1980s.The Democratic contender accused Trump of jeopardizing Michigan auto jobs.\"This is a man who has only ever fought for himself. This is a man who has been a union buster his entire career,\" she said at a stop in Detroit.Later, in the city of Flint, she branded Trump \"one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history.\"Flint is a majority Black city where a 2010s scandal over lead-tainted water highlighted government mismanagement and the disproportionate damage to poor and non-white communities.She reminded rallygoers that the election is just one month away, and early voting has already begun in several states.\"Folks, the election is here. And we need to energize, organize and mobilize,\" Harris said.Earlier, her campaign announced that the country's first Black president, Barack Obama, would stump for her in Pennsylvania and other swing states from next week as she woos undecided voters in the US heartland.",

This comet was discovered on the night of December 20, 1900 at the In addition, the study of this comet was historic, as it is the first to be directly explored by the International Cometary Explorer in September 1985, to become the first comet visited by a space probe. It is also one of the two meteor showers that cross the firmament in October each year. The second is the When will the Draconid meteor shower begin? The Draconids will occur peaking in the evening of October 7 and continuing until dawn on October 8, when the shower reaches its radiant point between the stars Eltanin and Rastaban in the head of Draco, located in the northern hemisphere firmament. For meteor watchers, who observe the Draconids, the radiant point of the meteor shower reaches its highest point at dusk. In addition, this phenomenon has the advantage that it can be observed with the naked eye, so anyone with a telescope can witness this phenomenon, with a clear sky, but away from the night lights of big cities.

      "content": "Just like the first season before it Showtrial season 2 tackles a number of hot topic issues in amidst the legal drama. This season, which stars Adeel Akhtar and Michael Socha , centres around the hit and run death of a climate change activist, with a police officer becoming the prime suspect – opening the doors for a wealth of discussions around protest, policing and justice. At a recent Q&A for the show, executive producer Simon Heath was asked whether he was ever nervous about taking on such contentious discussion topics, to which he said: \"We pride ourselves on being a bit provocative and upsetting people. \"I don't think we're doing our job if we're not really. Actually, the thing about climate change, I suppose, the worry there is always that people think you're going to do something a bit worthy, a bit wholemeal bread and a bit woke. \"And I think what was clever and what Ben [Richards, creator] has done, I think, as the best drama should, it's not taking a position. It’s putting all the voices and giving them equal weight, and then letting the audience decide.\" Richards revealed that in many ways he sees Akhtar's character, the defence solicitor, as a cipher for his own views on the matters being discussed, before adding: \"I think, actually there's a lot to be angry and upset about. \"Not particularly any side of the culture war, but actually from, I'm going to sound ridiculous now, from the point of view of basic morality.\" Read more: BBC offers first look at Agatha Christie’s Towards Zero starring Sex Education star Industry's Kit Harington reveals \"entitled\" season 3 character is \"moulded on various people\" He continued: \"But also to try not to wag fingers at people, to try not to lecture people, to try not to tell people there's a right and wrong answer to everything, and try and see the humour and humanity in situations. \"The internet's such a horrible place, full of people screaming at each other and abusing each other and I always think that out in the real world, people tend to have much more relaxed and humorous conversations about these things. Actually, we don't get as angry and hateful as often the internet is. \"So it was kind of trying to capture that and say, ‘Yeah, you can have attitudes and things, you can have opinions on things, but you can also laugh with your loved ones about it, it doesn't all have to be an all or nothing thing’.\" At the Q&A, Richards also opened up on why he chose not to bring any season 1 characters back for season 2, saying it was primarily for the sake of \" basic realism \".

      "description": "In the past decade, underground electronic and experimental scenes in Asia forged new connections across borders. Is a global movement next?",
      "content": "At Boiler Room’s first post- event in Seoul, in 2022, one set stood out among the rest. Wearing a colorful umbrella hat and wielding thick iron scissors, Seoul-based DJ and producer Seesea high-octane K-pop edits and a bouncy, backbeat-heavy genre known as “trot” or “ppong-tchak” to a throng of sweaty bodies. A cross between Japanese enka and Western dance music that emerged during the Japanese colonial period, trot has evolved over the years and is sometimes thought to contain a uniquely Korean spirit; earlier in 2022, producer 250 released , a culmination of close to a decade of “ ” in used electronics stores around Dongmyo and daytime dancing studios called cola-teks. While the online response to Seesea’s set was mixed, the gurgly analog synths and gravelly singing of ppong-tchak went over well among the crowd, largely aware of the cultural context of ppong and its revival among local DJs searching for an indigenous Korean sound. In the past decade, underground electronic and experimental scenes in Seoul, Manila, Tokyo, Ho Chi Minh, Shanghai, Taipei, Bangkok—the list goes on—began developing their own vernacular and forming a network within Asia. It’s healthy to exercise caution whenever “Asia” is invoked; from economic unions like ASEAN to violent imperialist projects like the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, pan-Asianism has historically been a top-down, homogenizing endeavor. This new pan-Asianism, however, is more of a bottom-up, inter-Asian phenomenon. These are brash, maximalist sounds, an alternative to the tasteful techno of European clubs. A key moment was in 2020, when artist collective and record label Eternal Dragonz dropped , a fundraising compilation supporting L.A. and Australian community organizations that brought together scenes in Seoul, Ha Noi, Kuala Lumpur, and Tokyo in a reverb-soaked haze of introspection and protest. A year later, UK club collective Eastern Margins released , a supercharged homage to ppong-tchak’s analogs in other Asian countries: Indonesian funkot, Vietnamese vinahouse, Singapore/Malaysian manyao, and Filipino budots. And, in 2022, London electronic music label CHINABOT celebrated its fifth year anniversary with merging electroacoustic detritus with traditional timbres from Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand and the United Kingdom. These efforts, in tandem with the work of Asian artists, have borne fruit. In 2023, headed Boiler Room’s coveted Broadcast Lab, attaining a global platform for Filipino club maximalism. Budots pioneer played a set controversial among buttoned-up techno lurkers, yet hipping Western listeners to the street music genre omnipresent in the Philippines since the 2000s. In South Korea, one key figure in cultivating an inter-Asian cultural sphere between underground artists and cultural institutions is . Park wears many hats—noise artist, promoter, DJ, and label head—and is the founder of Asian Music Party, which he’s been throwing since its inaugural 2015 iteration with Japanese DJ crew Soi48. Two years later, he also started , a curatorial project aiming to “create a sound network of experimental / improvised / independent music in Asia.” The inaugural gathering in 2017, at alternative art space Post Territory Ujeongguk, hosted talks, film screenings, and performances by Yan Jun, Martinus Indra Hermawan, and Dawang Huang. And his efforts have increased in the post-pandemic years, expanding to the club scene: In 2022, Park brought Vietnamese collective to perform at the Seoul Metropolitan Museum of Art alongside Seesea and experimental club musician . After the pandemic, Park’s also been joined by C Bong Sae and Palpaljeong, a DJ duo who run the underground space . Their raucous parties, including the flagship , frequently feature budots, funkot, ppong-tchak, and other hard dance hybrids that comprise what they call “ ,” a pun on a Korean phrase meaning “weird mushroom” (괴상한 버섯) and the Dutch hard dance genre. Japan, in particular, has had a lingering fascination with regionalism after World War II: Fukuoka’s Asian Art Museum, opened in 1999, claims to be “the only museum in the world that systematically collects and exhibits Asian modern and contemporary art.” And many of the Japanese selectors unearthing sounds from Asia might be considered modern-day ethnomusicologists: Shibuya party has been spinning funkot since 2010; Tokyo DJ collective Soi48 spread their love for mor lam throughout the region; Murakami Kyoju and Kishino Yuichi make regular pilgrimages to Myanmar to dig for the country’s percussive court music hsaing waing; and Hasegawa Yohei, who played in seminal Korean indie bands like Kiha and the Faces, flexes his encyclopedic knowledge of Korean and Sinophone rare groove in his mixes. In the realm of noise music, Otomo Yoshihide’s Asian Meeting Festival and Far East Network have linked Ryu Hankil (Korea), Yan Jun (China), Yuen Chee Wai (Singapore) and dj sniff (Hong Kong) with improvisers across the region. The history of pan-Asianism in Japan, however, is not innocent. Since Japanese art historian Okakura Kakuzō’s 1903 declaration that “Asia is one,” the imagined unity of this region has served as a rallying cry against Western imperialism, although the idea would become a pretext for Japanese conquest of large swaths of the region during World War II. So it’s important to ask: Is this so-called new inter-Asianism any different from what we’ve seen in past artistic and political movements? Yes and no. It’s a common critique that pan-Asianism is mainly invoked by East Asian countries or individuals, leaving out their Southeast Asian counterparts. Indeed, the first attempt at a modern pan-Asian movement in music might’ve been the Asian Composer’s League, founded in 1973. Its founding members were from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea, all composing in the Western classical tradition and hailing from countries on this side of the Iron Curtain. But the new inter-Asian underground, led increasingly by Southeast Asian artists, rearticulates that history on a bottom-up, scene-to-scene level, acknowledging these irreconcilable differences while imagining new ways to think about mutual recognition and connection. DIY organizations are leveraging institutional funding to help local Asian scenes gain broader recognition. From 2018 to 2022, Manila’s experimental arts festival participated in , a project in collaboration with Indonesia’s , Singapore’s , and Berlin’s CTM Festival that aimed to research “experimental sound and music cultures in Southeast Asia, enabling dialogue within the region, with Europe, and beyond.” Featuring English-language articles on budots, dangdut, protest music, and noise, Nusasonic’s , along with their and 2022 compilation album , make a case for a new inter-Asianism in the underground. The upshot is that Asian underground artists are looking less at the West and more to their neighbors as sources of inspiration. Berlin is no longer the center of the universe for club heads, though these DJs sometimes pay them a visit. At CTM this year, Thai producer curated a series titled , calling up Korea’s C Bong Sae (one of the owners of Seoul DIY venue ACS), Teya Logos, and Malaysian DJ Wanton Witch to draw together the common threads of protest and sound in their respective contexts. Coupled with the diaspora’s shared experience of being marginalized, this inter-Asian solidarity has the potential to link together a widely disparate group of people. Of course, these differences often make collaboration difficult: In a 2016 interview with , Otomo Yoshihide said that Korea, Japan, China and Singapore “have never talked like this before. We have no chance to meet. Even no common language together.... Because there’s just no chances, and of course historically, it’s not really good, the last 100 years, especially between Korea, Japan and China.” Sometimes the geopolitical hierarchies within Asia become insurmountable. Earlier this year, ACS tapped Pinoy DJ Teya Logos to play in Seoul, but, at the last minute, she had to cancel because the Korean embassy denied her visa. While Western artists seem to have no problem entering Korea, it’s much harder for artists from Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and the Philippines to get visas because of South Korea’s . And efforts at political solidarity between East and West Asia have sometimes fallen on deaf ears: Pisitakun’s still went on at Berghain, despite Ravers for Palestine’s call for of the club due to its silencing of pro-Palestinian voices. Will all of this lead to a truly global sensation like the in the 1990s? I don’t think so, and, in some ways, I hope not. What’s exciting here are the increasing interactions on a scene-to-scene level: Seoul club crew linking with Taichung venue and party ; Ho Chi Minh City tricksters collaborating with Korean deconstructed club producer ; Tokyo-based Soi48 throwing parties at Bangkok’s . With music scenes in Asia looking to each other for inspiration, it’s us in the West who will need to catch up.",

      "description": "One helpful tool is by following a disaster fraud timeline which outlines the deceptive practices like price gouging a person can anticipate following a disaster",
      "content": "Hurricane Helene , which first made landfall as a Category 4 in Florida on Sept. 26, has since carved out a 500-mile path of destruction. The hurricane swept through Florida, the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee uprooting homes, collapsing critical infrastructure, and knocking out power and phone service. So far, the death toll has surpassed 200, according to CNN , though it’s expected to rise. Its extreme winds, record-level rainfall, severe flooding, and relentless mudslides have led to a lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical supplies across the Southeast. As federal and local disaster relief organizations step in to provide life-saving aid, Caitlin Morgenstern and Amelia Hoppe, co-founders of the New Orleans-based disaster rights advocacy organization Emergency Legal Responders, want natural disaster survivors to consider support that often gets overlooked: their legal protections. “After a disaster, everybody thinks of food, they think of water, they think of shelter, they think of medical but they don’t think of legal and social services,” Hoppe says. “In the end, actually, legal and social services [are] so important because it has the longest generational impact. We’re still helping people with cases from [Hurricane] Katrina, and we’re helping people with cases in Maui and all over.” Morgenstern and Hoppe founded Emergency Legal Responders in 2017 with an aim to help people plan and recover from a natural disaster. They strive to inform natural disaster survivors of their legal rights. The duo, who have a combined 23 years of experience in disaster relief, spoke to Rolling Stone about how to follow a legal needs timeline, how to identify disaster fraud, and how to apply and appeal for disaster recovery programs. In preparation for a natural disaster, Emergency Legal Responders encourage people to follow a disaster checklist, or a worksheet that details the five types of documents a person may need following a disaster. This includes identification paperwork (i.e. birth certificates, passport), personal documents (i.e. custody documents, wills), medical information (i.e. allergy list, insurance cards), financial documents (i.e. tax information, bank account information), and housing information (i.e. proof of address, rental agreements). The legal advocacy group also suggests storing the documents in a weatherproof folder just before a storm strikes, which they suggest testing in a bathtub. Following Hurricane Helene, the nonprofit partnered with mutual aid groups in the six affected states on Sept. 28 to distribute disaster checklists to residents. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 25 Most Influential Creators of 2024 A post shared by Emergency Legal Responders (@emergencylegalresponders) “One of the big things that happened after Katrina, was that the National Guard wasn’t letting individuals back into their neighborhoods or homes because they didn’t have identification that matched the address of where they lived,” Hoppe says. “Just from experience, I’m imagining that’s going to be something people are going to have to be dealing with.” Morgenstern and Hoppe also put together a legal-needs timeline which helps affected residents plan for the six weeks to a year after a disaster. Within the first six weeks, for example, Hurricane Helene survivors should begin filing insurance claims, utility issues, applications for Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, and look out for false eviction notices, and security deposit disputes, Morgenstern says. “It’s not a matter of, if there’s a disaster, it’s when,” Morgenstern says, “With Helene, a lot of places were hit that hadn’t ever seen a disaster of this scale.” Another helpful tool is the disaster fraud timeline, which outlines the deceptive practices a person can anticipate following a disaster. For example, within the first six weeks disaster survivors are susceptible to price gouging or exorbitant prices on necessities like water, hotel rates, gas, and groceries, which Morgenstern says is already taking place in states like North Carolina , Florida, and Georgia. They’ve already heard of reports of contractor fraud in Steinhatchee, located in Florida’s Big Bend region, a common threat within the first six months after a disaster.

Try to always get a contract or something in writing, and only give a partial deposit.” Predatory attorney practices will also begin springing up in the affected regions. Following Hurricane Ida, a Texas law firm faced a federal investigation after allegedly mishandling thousands of lawsuits over property damage in Louisiana. Morgenstern says that hurricane survivors need to look out for targeted ads placed by law firms, disguised as federal aid programs. She advises people to check for “.org” or “.gov” when applying for disaster aid from nonprofit organizations or federal programs. When applying for federal disaster relief programs like FEMA, residents have 60 days from the date a disaster is declared by the President to apply for resources, which can be extended from state to state based on circumstance. FEMA has also begun providing $750 checks to survivors in 17 Florida and 26 North Carolina counties for emergency needs like food, water, first aid, and prescriptions. On the other hand, if an applicant selects the wrong status for a claim, such as determining if they’re within the “boarders,” “renters,” or “household” category, it can cause their application to get denied. If this happens, Morgenstern says to “appeal, appeal, appeal” as many times as possible. Emergency Legal Providers provide FEMA’s disaster assistance guides on social media along with in-person and virtual educational events around post-disaster services. Here’s the quick and dirty on the recent changes 👉 to disaster aid fund$$ Changes apply to disasters after March 22, 2024 #Disaster #FEMA #Recovery FEMA’s complex terminology could halt applicants from getting life-saving funds, Hoppe adds: “FEMA could totally renew itself, everything could be so great, but if it’s not accessible, there’s no point. Unless there’s language access, unless there’s community access, unless there’s social access, there’s actually no point to all that work.” For Hoppe, it’s a priority to not only provide resource guidelines, set up disaster clinics and educational trainings, but to let the public know, “disaster and social services are part of the emergency landscape.”",

      "description": "The Vanguard Emerging Markets Bond Fund took a cautious positioning at the start of the year, which has helped it beat the majority of its peers.",
      "content": "A debt crisis is brewing in Africa. The continent's debt obligations – which topped $1 trillion at the end of 2023 – could compromise future economic growth, according to the African Development Bank. And in recent years, a handful of countries, including Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia, have defaulted. This news prompted us to check in with the Vanguard Emerging Markets Bond Fund ( VEMBX ) – a member of the Kiplinger 25, our favorite no-load mutual funds . Managers Dan Shaykevich and Mauro Favini invest mostly in dollar-denominated government debt issued in developing countries. At last report, the fund held 13% of its assets in African IOUs. That's a greater percentage than in the fund's benchmark, the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond index, but less than that of the fund's typical peer.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. The managers are not worried, though. Despite the hefty debt burden in Africa overall, defaults in African sovereign bonds so far have been small in size relative to the benchmark, says Favini. And the \"overall asset class of dollar-denominated emerging-markets debt hasn't experienced material drawdowns or contagion,” he says. Meanwhile, the fund is still outpacing its peers. Over the past 12 months, it returned 14.4%, beating 65% of other emerging-markets bond funds . A \"cautious\" positioning heading into 2024 contributed to the fund's performance over the past year. The managers took profits in their \"down-in-quality\" holdings, for instance. Making the right macroeconomic calls in 2023 helped, too, says Favini. Among them: Bumping up the fund's duration, a measure of interest rate sensitivity, to 6.5 years from 3 years. Bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions, so a duration of 6.5 years implies that if rates fall by one percentage point over the course of one year, the fund's net asset value will rise by 6.5%. Over the past 12 months, some emerging central banks, including China, Brazil and Mexico, have cut interest rates. The fund yields 6.4%.

      "description": "The future of six Swindon leisure centres has been secured for the next 15 years.",
      "content": "The future of six Swindon leisure centres has been secured for the next 15 years and an investment of more than £1.4 million has also been agreed for two of these centre's. The council’s cabinet has agreed to remove mutual break clauses in the contract with GLL, the company that manages these centres, ensuring their leases will now run until October 31, 2039. Previously, both parties could have opted to terminate the leases on October 31, 2028. The decision guarantees GLL, which operates under the Better brand, will continue to manage the Link Centre, Croft Leisure Centre, Delta Tennis Centre, Dorcan Recreation Centre, Haydon Wick Leisure Centre, and the Health Hydro for the next 15 years. The council hopes this will provide GLL with long-term certainty and the confidence to continue investing in the buildings it operates. Councillor Marina Strinkovsky, Swindon Borough Council’s cabinet member for placemaking and planning, said: \"We’ve been working really closely with GLL since last year on a number of social value initiatives to benefit local residents. \"We were therefore really keen to solidify that partnership by removing the break clauses in the leases for our six leisure centres, which will allow GLL to invest with confidence in the facilities it operates. “GLL has really stepped up to support some of our most vulnerable residents at a time when people are finding it tough with the cost of living crisis. We look forward to continuing our work with them to build a fairer Swindon over the coming years.” Councillors have also approved additional funding for two major leisure facilities in the borough. A sum of £115,000 will be spent on the ongoing refurbishment of the Health Hydro, while an extra £1.3 million will go towards a larger package of improvements at the Link Centre. The council, in collaboration with GLL, has already replaced the Link Centre’s ice rink, which was damaged by flooding last September, at a cost of £375,000. This has significantly reduced the centre's electricity consumption, energy costs, and carbon emissions. GLL has launched a range of initiatives to benefit residents, such as a free Residents’ Card, which provides a membership with 10 per cent off activities and a Pay as you Go concessionary membership card. It has also introduced a ‘Kids in Care’ membership, providing children in care with a free membership, while young adults aged up to 25 who have been in care can also access a special membership.",

      "description": "You've probably heard Nebraska volleyball players and coaches talk about the team's \"culture.\" But what does that actually look like?",
      "content": "The oft-discussed culture of the Nebraska volleyball program is sometimes difficult to see clearly. But you'll definitely see it when you watch the second-ranked Huskers play against Iowa on Sunday. The culture taking hold is right there when you watch Bergen Reilly play defense. Reilly sets out to block better than expected for a player of her height and digs hard shots from the opponents’ hitters. When you scan Nebraska’s stats through 51⁄2 weeks of the season, one thing that jumps off the page is Reilly’s 141 digs, No. 2 on the team behind Lexi Rodriguez with 179. Sure, Reilly gets more chances for digs as one of the only players who rarely leaves the court. But she’s proving she’s out there to do more than run Nebraska’s offense. She also has 25 blocks. The Sioux Falls, South Dakota, native says her mentality to play defense was something she picked up in Lincoln. “I think it’s come in college, honestly,” the sophomore said. “I was never really focused on defense. In high school, it was never really a huge priority, especially as setter. Setters just don’t really play a lot of defense.” When she got to college, Reilly saw how players such as Rodriguez, Laney Choboy and Maisie Boesiger played back-row defense and wanted to try and match that. Now you can add freshman Olivia Mauch to that list also. “Nebraska is known for its defense, so they all push me every single day,” Reilly said. Last week in a win against UCLA, Reilly even got a solo block. On the court with her teammates Kennedi Orr and Harper Murray each gasped in astonishment at what Reilly had done. “Blocks always feel great, especially when they’re one-on-one,” Reilly said. Her skill and confidence on defense comes from practices. At Nebraska, if you’re not improving on defense that’s on you. “We do defense every single day in our gym,” Reilly said. “And it’s not just a quick short burst. We’re going for a while at defense. It’s just getting it in your head that this ball is not going to get past me, and this ball is not going to hit the floor.” Before coming to college, sometimes practicing defense for Reilly was mostly through six-on-six play. At Nebraska, the back-row defenders face hundreds of shots during a week of practice, sometimes hit or tossed by the head coach himself. “So we’re prepared when we get to a game for whatever comes at us,” Reilly said. Defense is how Reilly has improved the most in college. “It’s been a change in mentality, and defense is honestly 90% mentality that I’m not letting this ball hit the floor,” she said. In recent years Nebraska has routinely been one of the best defenses in the country. Each of the past two seasons Nebraska ranked No. 1. Nebraska having a top defense wasn't the case to start this year, but now Nebraska is making the slow climb back up the rankings. The Huskers are ranked 38th, with an opponent hitting percentage of .164. During the early part of the season Nebraska did have a few matches on defense when its blockers weren’t in the right spots enough. But some of the higher hitting percentages for Nebraska’s opponent was also a reflection of the better teams it was playing. “We played a significantly tougher schedule then we did last year,” coach John Cook said. “Last year we scheduled lighter because we had five freshmen and a transfer. But this year our schedule was pretty tough.” During the Big Ten season the Huskers will have more time to scout and practice for each opponent, and when Nebraska has a few days to prepare for an opponent under Cook and defensive coordinator Jaylen Reyes Nebraska’s defense is often very good. During a three-set win against USC last week, the Trojans had a hitting percentage of .000 in the final set, when Nebraska had three blocks and 19 digs. “I just thought our block and defense really took over that match,” Cook said. * Nebraska junior middle blocker Rebekah Allick ranks No. 4 in the country in blocks (1.52 per set). * Iowa was shut out in the win column in Big Ten play last season, going 0-20. This year the Hawkeyes already have two wins, with five-set victories against Rutgers and Maryland last week. The Hawkeyes (8-7, 2-1 Big Ten) lost 3-0 against No. 25 Washington on Friday.

Last week in a win against UCLA, Reilly even got a solo block. On the court with her teammates Kennedi Orr and Harper Murray each gasped in astonishment at what Reilly had done. “Blocks always feel great, especially when they’re one-on-one,” Reilly said. Her skill and confidence on defense comes from practices. At Nebraska, if you’re not improving on defense that’s on you. “We do defense every single day in our gym,” Reilly said. “And it’s not just a quick short burst. We’re going for a while at defense. It’s just getting it in your head that this ball is not going to get past me, and this ball is not going to hit the floor.” Before coming to college, sometimes practicing defense for Reilly was mostly through six-on-six play. At Nebraska, the back-row defenders face hundreds of shots during a week of practice, sometimes hit or tossed by the head coach himself. “So we’re prepared when we get to a game for whatever comes at us,” Reilly said. Defense is how Reilly has improved the most in college. “It’s been a change in mentality, and defense is honestly 90% mentality that I’m not letting this ball hit the floor,” she said. In recent years Nebraska has routinely been one of the best defenses in the country. Each of the past two seasons Nebraska ranked No. 1. Nebraska having a top defense wasn't the case to start this year, but now Nebraska is making the slow climb back up the rankings. The Huskers are ranked 38th, with an opponent hitting percentage of .164. During the early part of the season Nebraska did have a few matches on defense when its blockers weren’t in the right spots enough. But some of the higher hitting percentages for Nebraska’s opponent was also a reflection of the better teams it was playing. “We played a significantly tougher schedule then we did last year,” coach John Cook said. “Last year we scheduled lighter because we had five freshmen and a transfer. But this year our schedule was pretty tough.” During the Big Ten season the Huskers will have more time to scout and practice for each opponent, and when Nebraska has a few days to prepare for an opponent under Cook and defensive coordinator Jaylen Reyes Nebraska’s defense is often very good. During a three-set win against USC last week, the Trojans had a hitting percentage of .000 in the final set, when Nebraska had three blocks and 19 digs. “I just thought our block and defense really took over that match,” Cook said. * Nebraska junior middle blocker Rebekah Allick ranks No. 4 in the country in blocks (1.52 per set). * Iowa was shut out in the win column in Big Ten play last season, going 0-20. This year the Hawkeyes already have two wins, with five-set victories against Rutgers and Maryland last week. The Hawkeyes (8-7, 2-1 Big Ten) lost 3-0 against No. 25 Washington on Friday.

      "content": "भारत और बांग्लादेश के बीच तीन मैचों की टी20 सीरीज की शुरुआत आज ग्वालियर से हो चुकी है. दोनों टीमें पहले मुकाबले के लिए अपनी कमर कस चुकी हैं. मुकाबले में भारत ने टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी करने का फैसला किया है. भारत की ओर से दो युवा खिलाड़ियों को सपना सच हुआ और दोनों को टीम इंडिया की प्लेइंग 11 में शामिल कर डेब्यू करने का मौका मिला है. यह दो खिलाड़ी मयंक यादव और नितीश रेड्डी हैं. दोनों ने पिछले कुछ समय से अपने प्रदर्शन से सबको काफी प्रभावित किया है. कौन हैं मयंक यादव? मयंक यादव के करियर पर नजर डाले तो इस युवा गेंदबाज का करियर अभी छोटा है. हालांकि अपने छोटे करियर में ही मयंक ने अपनी एक अलग छाप छोड़ी है. दिल्ली के लिए घरेलू क्रिकेट खेलने वाले मयंक ने 14 टी20 मुकाबले अब तक खेले हैं. इसमें उन्होंने कुल 19 विकेट अपने नाम किए हैं. मयंक आईपीएल 2024 के दौरान काफी सुर्खियाों में आए थे. वह आईपीएल के दौरान लगातार 150+ किलोमीटर प्रति घंटे की रफ्तार से गेंदबाजी कर रहे थे. कौन हैं नितीश कुमार रेड्डी? मयंक यादव की तरह नितीश कुमार रेड्डी ने भी आईपीएल 2024 के दौरान काफी चर्चा में आए थे. इस प्रतिभावान ऑलराउंडर ने आईपीएल में सनराइजर्स हैदराबाद के लिए गेंद और बल्ले दोनों से कमाल का प्रदर्शन किया था. नितीश अपनी विस्फोटक बल्लेबाजी के लिए मशहूर हैं. उन्होंने आईपीएल 2024 में 15 मैच में 142.9 की औसत से 303 रन बनाए थे. हाल ही में नितीश ने घरेलू सीरीज में भी कमाल का प्रदर्शन किया था. उनकी इस प्रतिभा को देखते हुए ही उन्हें भारतीय टीम में शामिल किया गया है. भारत की प्लेइंग 11 अभिषेक शर्मा, संजू सैमसन (विकेटकीपर), सूर्यकुमार यादव (कप्तान), नितीश रेड्डी, हार्दिक पंड्या, रियान पराग, रिंकू सिंह, वाशिंगटन सुंदर, वरुण चक्रवर्ती, अर्शदीप सिंह, मयंक यादव.",

      "description": "Liverpool boss Arne Slot 'insists' on a shock move for the 23-year-old and believes he can 'become a Premier league great' under his command.",
      "content": "Liverpool boss Arne Slot believes former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood can ‘become one of the great players in the Premier League’ under his watch and ‘insists’ on a shock move for the 23-year-old. A case against Greenwood of alleged rape and assault was discontinued by the Crown Prosecution Service at the start of 2023 after the withdrawal of key witnesses significantly reduced the chance of conviction. Man Utd pulled the plug on his return ahead of the 2023/24 campaign and he joined La Liga side Getafe on loan, contributing eight goals and six assists, before moving to Marseille in a permanent £26m deal ahead of the current campaign. Greenwood is already being linked with another move after five goals and an assist in his first seven games for the Ligue 1 side, with Barcelona thought to be chief among his suitors. But according to a report in Spain, Liverpool may also enter the running for his signature with Arne Slot apparently viewing Greenwood as a possible replacement for Mohamed Salah, who’s out of contract at the end of the season. It’s claimed Barcelona are attracted by the forward’s versatility, given he’s able to play anywhere across the frontline, but Slot and Liverpool are ‘willing to take advantage of’ Barcelona’s financial limitations. Greenwood ‘fits perfectly in the future plans of the Reds’ and Slot believes he can ‘become one of the great players in the Premier League’ and be ‘key to keeping the team competing at the highest level’.

Liverpool’s interest is unlikely to improve the mood of a number of key Manchester United figures who regret selling Greenwood for such a modest fee , according to GiveMeSport . ‘Key figures within Manchester United expected Greenwood to go on and become a £100million talent after seeing him break into the first-team picture following his progress through the youth ranks, according to GMS sources, and they remain extremely disappointed to have lost out on securing a potential nine-figure sum in the future. ‘GMS sources have been informed that La Liga giants Barcelona are interested in offering Greenwood a quickfire route out of his current surroundings, with head coach Hansi Flick and president Joan Laporta eyeing an opportunity to land a high-level performer with genuine elite potential on the cheap. ‘The Ligue 1 outfit are in a strong negotiating position as the one-cap England international penned a five-year contract worth close to £75,000-per-week when he joined in the summer, but his form and the attraction of suitors have left Manchester United frustrated by how his Old Trafford career came to an end. ‘GMS sources have been told that Barcelona are not the only side looking to tempt Greenwood away from Marseille as numerous clubs currently competing in the Champions League are also believed to be keeping a close eye on how he progresses this season, with divisional rivals Paris Saint-Germain one of the admirers considering upping the ante.’",

      "description": "MANILA, Philippines — It is safe to say that the dark days are over for the Colegio de San Juan de Letran Knights after wrapping up with a 6-3 win-loss card in the Round 1 of the NCAA Season 100 men's basketball tournament. After a 1-8 slate in the first round of the previous season, winning only against the San Sebastian College-Recoletos, the Knights buried the nightmare finish and returned to their high-caliber form. But for head coach Allen Ricardo, the job is not yet finished as he and his squad brace for the second round. The Knights were the back-to-back champions during Season 98 and 97, before falling to the slump in Season 99 where they only tallied two wins and absorbed 16 losses. \"We still have nine games, I hope we can [win] six or seven games, but the way things around, the competition, all of the teams and their standings are close to each other, so we don't know. The number eight or seven teams can rise. That's why we need a sense of urgency when we play, that's what I always tell them,\" Ricardo said. Letran capped the first round with a dominant win against the formidable Lyceum of the Philippines University, 78-66, last Oct. 5. With the head tactician remembering the 2-16 finish of the Knights, he stressed that there is no room for complacency despite a comfortable lead in the first round. \"The 5-2, 5-3 records, and now we're 6-3, that's nothing. But in the meantime, we will celebrate this small win, this gave us the confidence to come to the next round. Six wins is six wins.\"\"But we're still far.\"During post-game, players always stressed out Ricardo's encouraging words, which fueled them to perform at their best against their opponents. It was more than the \"pep talk\" that the head coach gave to his team, it was the trust and faith that changed the attitude and the body language of the Knights. \"For me, I started with their attitude. The techniques, all the basketball coaches here are good at what they do. In terms of X and Os they know it. For me, as a coach what I learned is that the attitude of the players should be right, they have the discipline, respect, and commitment is there.\" This led his players to reach their potential. Rookie Jimboy Estrada served as a starter, and he braved and stormed his defenders, continuously showing his mastery of doing flawless jumpers. Big man Kevin Santos slowly found his footing as he guarded the rim, and displayed more confidence after taking the NCAA Player of the Week plum. Ricardo showed faith in Deo Cuajao's clutch capabilities after scoring 15 points on four triples in the fourth quarter, winning against the College of Saint Benilde. Lastly, Pao Javillonar redeemed himself after returning to Letran and made a much introduction with a career-high of 28 points against Arellano. Only a few were mentioned above, but the Knights showed that they are one as a team whenever they go in a battle. Team captain Javillonar stressed that this season is all about bringing back the glory of Letran basketball. \"What motivates me is our last year's performance, we want to be back on track, we want to bring back the legacy of Letran.\"",

The Dutchman is a Premier League legend after scoring 132 goals for the Gunners during a clinical career in London before later going on to lead Manchester United to Premier League title glory. Van Persie was a constant thorn against Spurs throughout his prolific Arsenal stint scoring five times against the club's arch rivals who rued missing the chance to sign him during the icon's breakthrough years. The 41-year-old was snapped up by Arsene Wenger as a youngster at Eredivisie giants Feyenoord - who he later went on to manage - and former Tottenham boss and sporting director David Pleat has outlined how and why Spurs decided against trying to sign Van Persie. Pleat ended his over 20-year association with Spurs in July as the club shook up their scouting department and revealed how he was once responsible for assessing a young Van Persie.

'He came on as a sub, shirt out of his shorts, socks rolled down, looking a right mess. 'Steve Rowley at Arsenal had decided not to sign him, but they went for a second look and decided to take a chance,' he added. Tottenham's loss was Arsenal's gain - albeit limited when he decided to leave the club and join Sir Alex Ferguson's Man United as he sought to become a Premier League champion. Van Persie later turned his back on Arsenal to join Man United where he won the Premier League title Van Persie proceeded to score 26 top-flight goals during his debut season at Old Trafford to deliver a 13th Premier League title and the last of Ferguson's glorious reign.

      "content": "The Hoops battled back to see off Ross County during a dramatic clash in Dingwall Get the latest Celtic news sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest Celtic news sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Brendan Rodgers admits Celtic were far too comfortable in the first half of their dramatic come-from-behind win over Ross County . Dortmund may have ripped the out of it in midweek, but Rodgers felt the champions were firmly back in their comfort zone during the opening 45 minutes in Dingwall. Ronan Hale's retaken penalty two minutes before the break served as a wake up call, and a fire more fired up Celtic re-emerged from the tunnel after the break, and turned things around through Alistair Johnston and Nicolas Kuhn The Rodgers told Sky Sports: \"Listen, nothing surprises you. We just need it to be faster, we were just too slow. There's no easy game but you can't look for an easy game either. So you've got to get out of your comfort zone and I thought it was too comfortable first half. Just in everything; speed, , movement, not enough runs to break the line and it gave us very little. We had lots of the ball but not penetrating enough, but sometimes that can happen. You can't always be perfect. \"The second half, I thought the guys coming into the game - Paulo (Bernardo) and Luke (McCowan) were outstanding. Movement, flexible, got on the ball, made runs and Kyogo coming in stretched the line and Jamesy (Forrest) with his quality. So we had the means to affect the game and thankfully, things turned out well for us.\" Asked if the first half was down to a hangover from their Dortmund, Rodgers replied: \"Yeah, these things can happen. When you're playing against a well organised team, it can happen. \"But of course it's a big energy to put into the game like we had and then you;re coming here again and you have to produce the same energy to get the win. We just didn't quite have that in the first half. \"But thankfully the players showed a magnificent response. I've always said resilience, grit and determination - this team have that in bucket loads so we were able to get the result. Seven wins out of seven is a great start for us.\" Tune in to Hotline Live every Sunday to Thursday and have your say on the biggest issues in Scottish football.",

      "content": "India kept their Women's T20 World Cup hopes alive with a six-wicket win over rivals Pakistan on Sunday in Dubai. After being thumped by New Zealand just two days ago , India were in a near must-win situation against Pakistan. Pakistan won the toss and batted first but were limited to just 105 runs after some stunning bowling from India, including Arundhati Reddy and Shreyanka Patil who took five wickets between them. It was thought India would want to boost their net run rate, which was down at -2.9 after their defeat to New Zealand, but they were cautious with the run chase. Shafali Verma survived an initial dismissal after the fifth ball of the chase, only for a review to go her way as the ball was not hitting the wickets. Trending That proved to be a crucial moment as Verma got India on their way as she scored 32 runs before Aliya Riaz made a good catch. From there, India made steady progress and got over the line but they will be concerned as captain Harmanpreet Kaur limped off injured near the end after slipping.

Swayman, whose deal was announced Sunday morning, is entering his fifth NHL season. He has a record of 79-33-15, with a .919 save percentage and a 2.34 goals-against average. The 25-year-old was anointed as the Bruins' primary goaltender after they traded Linus Ullmark to the Ottawa Senators in June. But the lack of a contract agreement meant Swayman had declined to report to training camp. Editor's Picks Lapsed fan's guide to the 2024-25 NHL season: Everything you need to know 2d Greg Wyshynski The sides had also disagreed over the existence of a $64 million offer that team president Cam Neely referenced earlier this week. But Sunday's announcement puts to an end to the standoff and locks up the Bruins' goaltender as they seek their first Stanley Cup Final appearance since 2019. Swayman made $3.475 million on a one-year contract last season, which was awarded through arbitration. Information from ESPN's Greg Wyshynski was used in this report.",

      "content": "Makarova led a British domination of the Prix de l'Abbaye Longines on Arc day at ParisLongchamp. Ridden by Tom Marquand and trained by Ed Walker, Makarova was settled in the chasing pack as favourite Bradsell and Desperate Hero traded blows at the front end of the five-furlong sprint. It looked as though Bradsell might seal another Group One triumph entering the final furlong, but Makarova was making ground down the outside and swept through to win going away. Bradsell just held on for second from the fast-finishing Believing, with Desperate Hero fourth and No Half Measures fifth, with all those runners hailing from British yards. Camille Pissarro swooped late to grab glory in the Qatar Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere . Trending Trained by Aidan O'Brien, the colt benefitted from a vintage Christophe Soumillon ride as he recorded a first Group One success in the seven-furlong contest. Soumillon exercised plenty of patience in the early stages before allowing his mount to coast into contention in the straight. Also See: Full racing results Watch racing live on Sky Sports Rashabar put up a tremendous bid for Brian Meehan, but Camille Pissarro - who was well down the field when Rashabar won the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot - just edged the verdict in the shadow of the post, with the front-running Misunderstood clinging on for third. Francis-Henri Graffard trained the first two home as Vertical Blue caused an 100/1 upset in flooring hot favourite Zarigana in the Qatar Prix Marcel Boussac . All the talk pre-race surrounded the Aga Khan-owned market leader - who is a granddaughter of the great Zarkava - and after travelling in mid-division it looked as though she would only have to peg back Aidan O'Brien's enterprisingly-ridden Exactly to prevail. Her stablemate Vertical Blue went with her, however, and the judge had to be called to announce the outsider as the winner with Zarigana narrowly behind and Exactly in third.",

      "content": "External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday took a critical view of the United Nations, saying it was \"like an old company\", not entirely keeping up with the market but occupying the space.During an interaction at the Kautilya Economic Conclave here, he also said that two very serious conflicts are going on in the world. \"And where is the UN on them, essentially a bystander,\" the minister said. In response to a query on the possible outcome of the US elections, he said the US actually has \"made a shift\", geopolitically and in its economic outlook, and irrespective of the outcomes in November, many of these trends will \"intensify\" in the days to come. Jaishankar took part in the interactive session on 'India and the Globe' and spoke of India's role and challenges amid changing global dynamics. \"So, we are both a lifting tide and a bit of paradoxical one, a ballast as well,\" Jaishankar said as he enumerated some of the steps India has taken to help other countries, including its neighbours such as Sri Lanka. Asked about his upcoming visit to Pakistan to attend a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), he again sought to rule out any bilateral talks with his Pakistani counterpart. \"I am going there for a certain job, a certain responsibility. And, I take my responsibilities seriously. So, I am going there to represent India at the SCO meeting, and that is what I am going to do,\" Jaishankar said. At an event on Saturday, the external affairs minister said that he was going to Islamabad for a \"multilateral event\" and not to discuss India-Pakistan relations. In his response to a query on the United Nations' role amid the changing global scenario, he took a rather critical view of the world body that was born in 1945 after the Second World War. Initially, it had 50 countries, which has grown over these years to nearly four times. \"The UN is in a way like an old company, not entirely keeping up with the market, but occupying the space. And, when it's behind times, in this world you have start-ups and innovations, so different people start doing their own things,\" Jaishankar said. \"So, what you have today is that yes you have a UN at the end, however suboptimal in functioning, it is still the only multilateral game in town,\" he added. \"But, when it doesn't step up on key issues, countries figure out their own ways of doing it. For example, let's take the last five-10 years, probably the biggest thing that happened in our life was Covid. Now, what did the UN do on Covid? I think the answer is -- not very much,\" the minister said. Jaishankar said, \"Now, you have two conflicts going on in the world today, two very serious conflicts, where is the UN on them, essentially a bystander,\" he said. So, what is happening, as it did during Covid also, countries did their own thing such as the initiative like Covax that was done by a group of countries, the minister said. \"When it comes to big issues of the day, you have an increasing combination of countries coming together to agree to do something.\" He cited the examples of connectivity initiatives like the India-MiddleEast-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), QUAD in Indo-Pacific to look after the global commons, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), saying all these bodies came outside the UN framework. \"Today, the UN will continue, but increasingly there is a non-UN space which is the active space and I think it's telling on the UN,\" Jaishankar added. More than 75 years after its inception, the United Nations is still working to maintain international peace and security, give humanitarian assistance to those in need, protect human rights, and uphold international law, according to the UN website. India has been demanding reforms in the world body and its UN Security Council in sync with the changed times. Earlier this year, Jaishankar suggested that the \"short-sighted\" approach of the five permanent members of the UNSC is holding back forward movement in the long-pending reform of the global body. The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France and the US and these countries can veto any substantive resolution. Jaishankar was asked about a possible outcome of the US elections and how will India engage with the new administration. \"You spoke of one possibility of the two in the American elections. I stress to you, look back over the last five years, how many of the policies which in 2020 people thought were the Trump administration's policies actually not just carried over by Biden but they doubled down on those policies,\" he said. So, this is not just a politician, it's not just a fashion, just one administration. \"I think there are very deep shifts happening,\" the minister added. \"This is... America which actually has made a shift, geopolitically and in its economic outlook and has come to the conclusion that the order which itself devised many years ago no longer works to its benefit to that degree,\" he said. \"So, I would argue, irrespective of the outcomes in November, many of these trends will intensify in the days to come. And, you are going to get, I would call it a more fractured world, but I would say, in some ways, reliability and transparency are going to be two very key factors which will become a metric for countries to have enterprises and domains to have dealings with each other,\" he said. On a question on the Global South, Jaishankar said that it itself has a \"great value\". \"It is a collective. We don't expect to be the leader. We are seen as a trusted member, an articulate member... So, I am not really comfortable with the idea that you walk away from the Global South. On the contrary, I see value,\" the minister said. He also spoke on the role and impact of artificial intelligence in shaping the world going forward.",

That's what I did and I didn't take a forced shot,\" said Lingolingo, who finished with 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting with five rebounds and three steals to boot.\"When I couldn't find my spot in the three-point area, I just found a way to contribute, especially on the defensive end. I didn't expect the game-winning shot. I just happened to be there and I hit the shot thanks to God.\"The 6-foot-1 Lingolingo said that his game-winner was simply a case of right place, right time moment.\"That shot of mine as coach LA [Revilla] said was just a case of right place, right time. I just happened to be there, I saw the time and didn't hesitate.\"Lingolingo's patience didn't just reward him with easily the greatest shot of his life, it also gave UE its fifth straight win, a run only a few expected of the Red Warriors especially after the departure of star guard Noy Remogat.",

[...]The post Arsenal injury scare as in-form player to be “assessed” and sit out upcoming games appeared first on CaughtOffside.",
      "content": "According to Fabrizio Romano, posting on his official account on X, formerly Twitter, Havertz will be assessed by the Gunners and sit out the upcoming international break. This could just be Arsenal being cautious after they lost Martin Odegaard to a bad injury during the last international break, but one imagines fans will be a bit concerned by this update as Havertz has been such an important player for Mikel Arteta’s side so far this season. See below for the Havertz injury news from Romano’s X post... Arsenal signed Havertz before the start of last season and although it took the former Chelsea man a bit of time to get going, he’s now surely one of the first names on Arteta’s team sheets. 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium, while he’d also in the midweek Champions League game. Kai Havertz injury would leave Arsenal with limited options While it still isn’t clear how serious this is for AFC, it perhaps serves as a reminder of their lack of depth in attack, with Gabriel Jesus not looking like much of a backup at the moment. Leandro Trossard can also play up front but tends to better out wide, and the same is probably true of Gabriel Martinelli, while Eddie Nketiah was sold in the summer after previously being kept in reserve precisely for situations like this. There’ll be some Arsenal fans who’ll have been keen for the north Londoners to sign a striker in the summer, and if Havertz’s injury ends up being serious perhaps this will push the club to get something done in that position in January.",

      "description": "Twelve months on from his alarming assessment of Manchester United, Gary Neville has once again taken aim at his old club for the same issue to suggest nothing has changed",
      "content": "Manchester United icon Gary Neville has once again likened the club to \"a graveyard\" as the struggles at Old Trafford continue. It was exactly 12 months ago that the former England full-back said his old stomping ground had become a place for careers to die. Neville spoke about \"big problems\" at the Theatre of Dreams in October 2023, raising alarm after a poor start in Erik ten Hag 's second despite another influx of players. Fast-forward to today and United have won only three of their nine games in all competitions, including back-to-back draws in the Europa League . They've also lost successive Premier League home games to Liverpool and Tottenham , succumbing 3-0 on both occasions. Speaking to Rebecca Lowe on The Overlap US following the recent defeat to Spurs, Neville reiterated the point when he said: \"The idea that another manager can come in with great promise, great talent [and who] lots of clubs in Europe were looking at that Manchester United get . . .and it's been a graveyard for him. \"This club cannot continue being a graveyard for players and managers. There's got to be a stop put to it. And that's where I think Jim Ratcliffe [and other executive members], they've got to stand strong now and come up with solutions.\" Neville's comments bear a striking similarity to the ones he made 12 months ago, suggesting not much has changed at Old Trafford in that time – in his opinion at least. “I feel very sorry for the manager, I know a lot of people will say he’s got to do a lot better, and that’s fine, he’s the Manchester United manager, but there are a lot of big problems at the club that managers have found over the last ten years,\" Neville said previously. \"I think until those problems are solved we’ll still continue to see underperforming teams, underperforming players, it’s become a graveyard for coaches and players – it’s not too strong a term.\" Ten Hag once again finds himself under immense pressure to steer the ship back on course, with United back in familiar, gloomy territory. Neville and Lowe discussed some of those names who could replace the Dutchman if he were to be fired, which begs the question of what happens to his squad. Despite the struggles he's faced for much of his time in England, Ten Hag has been allowed to assemble a line-up replete with talent he's picked personally. And Neville pointed to decisions like these as being an example of why the club has hampered itself in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. \"That's where Manchester United have been, flip-flopping around for the last 12 years,\" he said. \"Every manager having a big influence over the transfers that have come into the club. Every next manager has been a different style of play and then basically wanted to change. And you've ended up with three or four managers' players in their squad, and trying to get a cohesive way of playing.\" Neville proceeded to call on directors Dan Ashworth, Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada and Sir Dave Brailsford to \"earn their corn\" amid tough times. However, it will take monumental change at numerous level of the club to have Old Trafford feeling less like a morgue anytime soon. _Join our new WhatsApp community _ _and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

      "content": "Ace Indian cueist Pankaj Advani won the coveted Songhe Singapore Open title with a 5-1 win over local favourite Jaden Ong in Singapore on Sunday. On his way to the final, Advani beat former IBSF world snooker champion Dechawat Poomjaeng of Thailand 4-3 in a thrilling quarterfinal at the Lagoon Billiards Room. While the 5-1 score of the final seems lopsided, the first two frames were won by the Indian clearing the colours from a deficit to pip the Singaporean on both occasions to take a 2-0 advantage.

A resurgent Ong pulled a frame back to be in contention. However, in the fourth, a brilliant snooker put by Advani on the final brown allowed him back in the frame and with a clean clearance from brown to black, Advani was one frame away from the championship. In the final frame, Advani scored a 74-6 win to lift the title. Advani will defend his world billiards title in Doha in November.

      "description": "India U-19 cricket team will take on Australia U-19 in the second and final Youth Test at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Monday.",
      "content": "After registering a thrilling two-wicket win in the first game, the India U-19 cricket team will look to close out on a high as it faces Australia U-19 in the second and final Youth Test at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Monday. Ahead of the first Test, India bulldozed Australia 3-0 in the ODI series, including two dominant wins by seven and nine wickets in the first and second matches, respectively. However, with just four out of the 11 players carried over from the ODI series, the Indian youngsters’ foray into the longest format was not without cause for concern. On a flat Chepauk pitch, Australia raced to 293 runs in just over two sessions on the first day to put India under pressure. In reply, India started positively with its openers — Vihaan Malhotra and Vaibhav Suryavanshi — putting together a solid 100-run opening stand. Thirteen-year-old Suryavanshi showcased his stroke-making calibre on the second day as well and went on to become the youngest-ever centurion in Youth Tests. He was dismissed for a 62-ball 104. However, his exploits were overshadowed by a subpar showing from the rest of the batters. ALSO READ | Duleep Trophy 2024: ‘Penalise teams with runs for slow over-rates’, says Rahane India was troubled the most by Aussie leg spinner Vishwa Ramkumar, who picked seven wickets across two innings. Despite having five left-handers in its arsenal, the home side conceded regular wickets to the 18-year-old, Indian-origin bowler. However, India does not have to look far for answers. Last game’s player of the match, Nikhil Kumar, who used his feet to counter everything that Ramkumar threw his way, will be in the spotlight again. He proved his mettle in this year’s Cooch Behar Trophy, where he amassed 275 runs in five matches at an average of 46.37. On the bowling front, India is on stabler grounds. Led by leg-spinner Mohamed Enaan, who ended up with nine wickets, Indian bowlers will look to continue to fire. Despite being thrust into unacclimatised conditions, Australia largely held its ground and even managed to stretch India to an extent. The only aspect where it missed the mark in the first match was its immature batting approach. Apart from its opener, Riley Kingsell, who scored 53 and 48 in two innings, respectively, none of the other batters could trouble the bowlers. They failed to convert their 20s and 30s into anything concrete and will reassess their strategies against Indian bowlers and will eye a different result on Monday. But, both India and Australia missed an opportunity to make final changes to their game plans. Their final day practice sessions were cancelled after almost half of the city faced traffic congestion due to the Indian Air Force air show that happened at the Marina Beach, just minutes away from the stadium.

      "content": "The tables have been well and truly turned around for Tyler Reddick. The man who won the regular season championship just four races ago now finds himself on the verge of being eliminated in the playoffs. As he goes into the Talladega race, a track where he won earlier this year, things are starting to get desperate for the #45 crew. There has been criticism over how things have been of late for Reddick and his team but 23XI Racing boss Denny Hamlin recently swooped into the defense of his best-performing driver so far this year. When Reddick became the regular season champion, confidence was at an all-time high. Many believed that there was not going to be any stopping the 28-year-old at least for the next few races. But he has had a dismal performance in the playoffs so far. It started with a decent P6 finish in Atlanta. However, since that race, he has finished P27 at the Glen, P20 at Bristol, and P25 at Kansas. His cushion of playoff points has kept him alive as he suffers a slump at the worst possible time. “Now, again this sport, you have these ebbs and flows and you’re not always going to be the fastest, but it just seems like the averages are now working themselves out. And, certainly, some of it too is the schedule and certainly these tracks that we’ve run. Four races in the Playoffs, it’s just hard to get results,” Hamlin said in a recent media interaction. Reddick’s recent record at Talladega will give him some confidence heading into Sunday’s race but he has his work cut out for him. The #45 will start from P14 surrounded by cars and in danger of wrecking out early if he isn’t alert enough. It will be interesting to see how he navigates through the pack during the race. Hamlin focused on winning the championship despite NASCAR lawsuit Reddick ’s issues aren’t the only thing that is worrying Hamlin at the moment. 23XI Racing is currently fighting a lawsuit against NASCAR over antitrust issues and the matter could drag on for months. He will hope that it does not affect his or any of his drivers’ races in the remainder of the season. Thankfully, it doesn’t seem like that will be the case for now. The 43-year-old also wants to win his first Cup Series championship and that’s what he’s focussing on alongside the same. “This has been on the plate for a while and certainly, from my standpoint it allows me actually more relief to focus on the 11 car and you know everything I’ve got to do there because it’s out it’s done and now there’s other people able to speak on it from the legality standpoint,” he explained. Reddick has also said that nothing has been uncomfortable since the lawsuit was filed racing-wise. Both drivers are laser-focused on becoming champions and keeping the off-track issues away from it. For race fans, that surely must be good to hear. No one wants to see a driver losing their form due to a legal battle that has nothing to do with on-track racing per se.",

      "description": "A deeper look into Moyes' four-man Manchester United shortlist during his torrid time in charge - including Real Madrid icon Gareth Bale.",
      "content": "David Moyes ’ stewardship of Manchester United is not remembered fondly by fans of the Red Devils. Recommended by the departing Sir Alex Ferguson , those associated with the club were confident about his appointment given he had the backing of the stubborn Scotsman. Employed for the solitary season, Glasgow-born Moyes was in the Old Trafford dugout between July 2013 and April 2014, overseeing 51 outings across all competitions, but ultimately failed to live up to the expectations which were exemplified by his predecessor. David Moyes - Man Utd Managerial Statistics Appointed 01/07/13 In charge until 22/04/14 Matches 51 Wins 26 Draws 10 Losses 15 Points per match 1.73 Now 61 years old, the ex- West Ham United boss is out of managerial work – so why not take a trip down memory lane to remember his four-man shortlist while in charge of the 13-time Premier League champions? According to reports at the time and interviews that have happened since his sacking in April 2014, Moyes had a quartet of stars on his radar pre-departure and looking back now, there was every chance that his managerial stay at the Theatre of Dreams could have been extended if his respective pursuits were fruitful. Leighton Baines Interestingly, Everton’s Leighton Baines was one of the names on the shortlist – and although he’s not the sexiest of names, the now-retired Englishman was a reliable figure on the left-hand side of defence for the Toffees and, for the right price, could have been a shrewd acquisition for the Red Devils. At the time that Moyes was interested in bringing his former left-back - alongside the Marmite-like Marouane Fellaini - to Old Trafford, Patrice Evra was forced to play in what was the Frenchman’s final season in the famed red of the club. GIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Out of the defenders, Baines has the third-most assists in Premier League history (53). Commonly regarded as one of the best penalty takers in English top-flight history , by virtue of his 90/9% success rate from the spot, Baines remained at Goodison Park post-Moyes interest. His availability, combined with his ageing body, meant that he gradually became the club’s second choice at left-back but he is certainly an all-time great for the club in the Premier League era. Two current Liverpool players are in a battle for top spot, with only one assist between them. Gareth Bale An electric winger who made a name for himself at Tottenham Hotspur after an impressive academy career at Southampton, Gareth Bale enjoyed the most illustrious stint of his career at Real Madrid. The Welshman, one of the greatest British wingers in football history , moved to Los Blancos in the summer of 2013 and won everything there is to win at club level. Bale’s stint in Spain seems to divide opinion due to his injury record and struggles to adapt to the culture – but should he have stayed in England, who knows what he could have achieved with Manchester United? The latter struggled to find a long-term heir for Cristiano Ronaldo after he left in 2009 and Bale’s superstardom would have filled the void. The 2010s was one of the best eras of football ever, but who are the best ten players of that decade? Having just picked up the Premier League ’s Player of the Year award, his confidence was sky-high – and if Moyes had got his hands on him, there was every chance that his stint would have lasted beyond the solitary campaign. Instead, the wide man joined Real Madrid and became one of the world’s best, bamboozling defences on a week-by-week basis. That said, some argue that his exploits were not best utilised in the Spanish capital thanks to playing in Ronaldo’s shadow. Bale retired in January 2023, aged just 33, and now spends his days playing golf. Toni Kroos Pre-Moyes, Manchester United were used to having a classy operator in the midfield: Paul Scholes. The Ginger Prince left alongside Ferguson, however, leaving the then-boss with a gaping hole in the middle of the park. Toni Kroos , one of the greatest deep-lying playmakers in football history , would have been the perfect replacement – or so Moyes thought. Despite his efforts, the Scot was unable to get his hands on the German, who was 23 years of age at the time, despite having a deal in place . He, per The Guardian , said: “Toni Kroos had agreed to come in the summer. I’d agreed it and with Toni himself and his agent. It was a done deal, so that was the level I was targeting – but sometimes you don’t get deals done.” A stroke of genius missed from the Manchester United higher-ups, Griefswald-born Kroos has since emerged as one of the greatest central midfielders of modern football history – and hung up his boots as a World Cup winner and a six-time Champions League winner this summer. Manchester United nearly signed legendary midfielder Toni Kroos before David Moyes was sacked by the club. Cesc Fabregas Cesc Fabregas is a true Premier League icon, having shone for both Chelsea and Arsenal over the years, but there was every chance the Spaniard could have played for Manchester United if Moyes had his way. A creative genius who had a knack for making onerous tasks look like second nature, the two-time Premier League champion At that time, midfielder Michael Carrick was no spring chicken in the engine room – and the addition of 27-year-old Fabregas, a man in his prime, would’ve been welcomed with open arms by the Old Trafford faithful. From Ashley Cole to Bukayo Saka, here are 10 of Arsenal's greatest academy products. Plying his trade for Barcelona at the time of Moyes' interest, the cool and collected engine room operator winded up in the Premier League - but playing for Chelsea . Spain and technically gifted footballers go hand in hand and Fabregas is a perfect example of that. Deployed in the Stamford Bridge engine room between 2014 and 2019 before joining French side Monaco, there were not many footballers as talented as the 110-cap Spain international, one who was part of La Roja's World Cup-winning squad in 2010. What a player he would have been for the Red Devils. He now works as head coach of Serie A club Como, having spent a brief spell with the Italian team as a player before retiring in 2023.

      "content": "India bounced back from the defeat against New Zealand in style as they defeated arch rivals Pakistan by 6 wickets on Sunday in their second match of the ongoing ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024. Batting first Pakistan were restricted to 105/8 in 20 overs largely due to the bowling efforts of Arundhati Reddy who bowled a match-winning spell of 3/19. Reddy was backed by Shreyanka Patil (2/12) and Renuka Singh, Deepti Sharma and Asha Sobhana all three of whom claimed a wicket each. Opener Shafali Verma's set the pace in the chase as she scored 32 off 35 balls. In the middle order Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur played scored a steady 29 in 24 balls and almost took India home. When India needed just two more runs to win, Harmapreet felt pain in her neck and had to be attended by the physio on the field. The pain did not subside and Harmanpreet had to walk off the field retired hurt. Harmanpreet's injury could prove to be a crucial blow for India who need to win their next two fixtures against Sri Lanka (October 9) and against defending champions Australia (October 13) in order to have a chance to qualify for the semifinals. Harmanpreet is the only India to have played across all the nine editions of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup.",

      "content": "Harmanpreet retired hurt when two runs were required for victory. Sajana Sajeevan, playing her first game, finished it off with a boundary. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur's years of experience saved India from blushes as they huffed and puffed to a six wicket win over arch rivals Pakistan, keeping their semi-final hopes alive in the Women's T20 World Cup, here Sunday. Indian batters made a heavy weather of a paltry 106-run target as it required a 24-ball-29 from their experienced skipper to eke out the crucial win. Harmanpreet retired hurt when two runs were required for victory. Sajana Sajeevan, playing her first game, finished it off with a boundary. The defensive approach by opener Shafali Verma (32 off 35 balls) and new No. 3 Jemimah Rodrigues (23 off 28 balls) meant that India could not boost their Net Run Rate which could prove very costly in the larger context of making it to the last-four stage. Despite the victory, India's NRR is currently -1.217 and they remain below Pakistan, who are in third place with NRR of -0.555. India would need to beat both Australia and Sri Lanka by comfortable margins to harbour any hopes of a semi-final berth. The entire Indian innings had only five boundaries and none of the top three looked like getting a move on. The chase was not exactly a cakewalk as Smriti Mandhana (7 off 16 balls) was out early while Shafali and Jemimah concentrated on taking singles. The running between the wickets wasn't impressive as some easy doubles and a sure triple was not even tried, probably due to sapping heat. Even as Jemimah showed some interest in pushing fielders, Shafali's poor fitness came in the way. Despite a negative net run-rate of -2.90, there was no intent shown by the Indian batters to surpass the paltry target in a good time. Shafali could hit only three shots to the fence in her 35-ball knock and she increased the pressure on the batting unit with the below-par effort. As far as Jemimah was concerned, power isn't diminutive Mumbaikar's forte as she is more of a batter who relies on timing and ability to find gaps. Once Fatima removed both Jemimah and Richa Ghosh (0) off successive deliveries, the onus was on Harmanpreet to take the team past home. Earlier, the Indian bowling unit fired in unison against a clueless Pakistan, restricting the arch-rivals to a lowly 105 for 8. Having conceded 160 against New Zealand on a slow track under lights in their opener, the Indian bowlers read the pitch well, and more importantly, took the pace off deliveries to make stroke-making all the more difficult. Such was their control that Indian bowlers were able to deliver 58 dot balls. Seamers Renuka Singh Thakur (1/23) and Arundhati Reddy (3/19) neither erred in line nor in length while off-spinners Deepti Sharma (1/24) and Shreyanka Patil (2/12) got enough grip and bounce to keep the Pakistani batters on tenterhooks. Leg-spinner Asha Sobhana (1/24) went for a few boundaries but got rival skipper Fatima with a big leg-break after the batter was brilliantly snapped by Richa Ghosh behind the stumps. Renuka bowled a tight first over and her inswinger had Gull Feroza (0) bowled through the gate. Deepti, who gave a much better account of herself, albeit against an inferior batting lineup, decreased the pace of her deliveries and also flighted a few. Pakistan managed only 29 for 2 in the powerplay and the Indian bowlers increased their stranglehold on the opposition batters with only Nida Dar's 28 providing some resistance to take the team past 100-run mark.

      "content": "The Pittsburgh Steelers will look to get back on the winning track in a Week 5 game against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night, and they will likely do so without Russell Wilson once again. Wilson, who was named the starter before the beginning of the season, has missed the first four games of the 2024 campaign due to a calf injury. He originally injured it in training camp, and then re-injured it prior to Week 1. In Wilson's absence, quarterback Justin Fields has gotten the ball and the Steelers are off to a 3-1 start with him under center. That has led many to believe that Wilson may not get his job back when healthy. A report from NFL Network's Ian Rapoport last week stated that Wilson was expected to be fully healthy this week, but it appears that is not the case, at least according to the team's injury report. Russell Wilson injury update According to the team's Week 5 injury report , Wilson is questionable to play due to his calf injury. The veteran signal-caller did not log a full practice the entire week, although he did appear to do a bit more. \"Quarterback Russell Wilson remained limited but confirmed that he started taking reps in 11-on-11 team drills and some limited 7-on-7 work, so he continues to ramp up his participation,\" Nick Farabaugh of PennLive.com wrote Thursday. “We’re listening to the doctors, listening to coach and just trying to make sure that they’re good and I’m good,” the Steelers quarterback said . “I feel strong, you know, I feel confident. I love the process that we’ve (had) in just in terms of just making sure that I’m really ready to go. And, you know, I feel like I’m right there.” On Saturday, Wilson posted a video of himself using an anti-gravity treadmill, so take that for what it's worth. Russell Wilson posted a clip of his rehab to his instagram story earlier today. Looks like he’s using an anti-gravity treadmill — which reduces the weight-bearing load on his calf — as part of his recovery. pic.twitter.com/9XuJGf5unx Will Russell Wilson play in Week 5? Despite Wilson ramping up a bit, he was limited in all three practices and draws a questionable tag. We've seen the same story every week so far this season, and each time it has led to Wilson being inactive. Expect the same this week.",

      "description": "Jay Cartmell, eight, suffered injuries to his head and face on land north of Warcop in Cumbria, on September 28.",
      "content": "The parents of an eight-year-old boy who was killed in a farm shooting have paid tribute to their son, remembering him as “loving, kind and full of mischief”. Jay Cartmell suffered injuries to his head and face on land near the A66, north of Warcop in Cumbria, on September 28. A man in his 60s was arrested at the scene and held on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter before being bailed. Jay’s parents, Leigha and James Cartmell, told of their heartbreak in a statement issued by Cumbria Police. They said: “We are heartbroken at the passing of our perfect little boy – Jay Cartmell, eight years. “He was loving, kind and full of mischief, the best boy that anyone could wish for and the third corner of our beautiful family ‘triangle’. “Jay loved being outdoors, the muddier he could get the better and was starting to follow in the footsteps of his dad with his obsession for speedway at Workington, where he first attended aged one years. “He always went to the pit to fist-bump his heroes, local racers Harry and Sam McGurk. “Jay was a talented rider himself and was showing real promise for the sport.” Jay also played football, and was a defender at Whitehaven Miners Football Club, where he would “occasionally” score an own goal, “but that didn’t dampen his enthusiasm”, his parents said. His favourite player was Manchester city striker Erling Haaland and he dreamed of moving to Brazil to meet Lionel Messi, they added. They also told of how Jay enjoyed fishing and rabbiting with his father and helped care for the family pets, including four lurchers, five ferrets and his own bearded dragon named Spike. He loved school and had a talent for maths, with parents adding: “Jay was extremely loved, not only by us, but by all who met him. “He had fantastic friends and always had a smile on his face. “We will miss him every day, but his love surrounds us and his memory will never fade.” Emergency services were called at around 2.50pm on September 28 to the property where a firearm was secured. Jay, from Frizington, Cumbria, was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he died overnight.",

      "content": "The German winger netted the winner against Ross County late in the game Get the latest news from Record Sport with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest news from Record Sport with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Mystified Kris Boyd has raised an eyebrow after Nicolas Kuhn avoided a second yellow card amid the madcap Celtic celebrations at Ross County. The winger made himself the hero in the Highlands and keep the Scottish Premiership leaders perfect start to the campaign going. After Alistair Johnston deflected the ball into the net to cancel out Ronan Hale's opener from the penalty spot, the German curled the ball into the far corner before rushing into the away end to celebrate with the fans in wild scenes. However, Kuhn had already been handed a booking by referee Kevin Clancy at Dingwall - and many expected him to be given his marching orders following the scenes after the goal. But the man in the middle kept his cards in his pocket, and immediately after the full-time whistle, Rangers hero Boyd was on the case of the winger and the whistler. He said on Sky Sports: \"Take nothing away from Celtic , it's a fantastic finish from Nicolas Kuhn. But, obviously you can just run into the crowd and celebrate and nothing happens.\" The Sky Sports team then swiftly moved on, before the wide man was put on the spot about the flashpoint during his post-match interview. Asked about the emotion of the moment and if he was thinking about the booking, Kuhn said: \"I didn't even know I had a booking. I don't know what it was for. I didn't think I did something.\" Boyd resfused to accept that answer when it cut back to the studio from the post-match area. He went on: \"The rules must have changed. I thought you got booked if you go into the crowd.\" Fellow pundit James McFadden pointed to the geography of the stadium as the real issue with the celebration: \"I know it's the rules, but it's very hard when it's three or four yards to stop yourself and go 'I'm not gonna celebrate'.\" Boyd wasn't satisfied, bluntly answering: \"Alright...\" Tune in to Hotline Live every Sunday to Thursday and have your say on the biggest issues in Scottish football.",

      "description": "Kawhi Leonard has struggled with fitness since joining the L.A. Clippers in 2019. Now, the star forward needs to strike a balance if he hopes to have the impact the Clippers need from him.",
      "content": "Kawhi Leonard has struggled with fitness since joining the L.A. Clippers in 2019. The two-time NBA champion suffered a torn ACL in 2021 and a torn Meniscus the following season. However, he bounced back to play in 68 regular-season games during the 2023-24 campaign, only to have his playoff availability impacted by swelling and soreness. Ty Lue and his medical staff are cautiously approaching Leonard's fitness heading into the new season after he underwent an offseason procedure . The veteran forward didn't participate in the team's opening preseason game against the Golden State Warriors and is unlikely to play in any upcoming preseason contests. When speaking to ESPN at halftime on Saturday, Leonard alluded to a potential change of approach on the court. He noted that he ran more miles per game than almost every player in the league and questioned whether that needs to change moving forward. \"We got to control what we can control,\" Leonard said. \"I probably ran like top five most miles per game last year or top 10. And that was coming off [a] torn meniscus [in the 2023 playoffs]. So we got to see if that's beneficial for me or not.\" Leonard's knee injuries have sapped some of his explosiveness. His first step isn't the space-creating weapon it was during his prime. He doesn't get the same lift when jumping off two feet anymore, either. However, his movement and ability to attack angles are a primary reason he's still an elite offensive player. If Leonard has to reduce how much he moves without the ball, his tenure as an elite forward in the NBA will likely be over. He will be reduced to a three-and-D role, where he could thrive but would be unlikely to take over games the way the Clippers need him to. As such, it's unlikely he makes such a drastic adjustment to his overall approach. Instead, the focus should be on maintaining the integrity of his surgically repaired knee and taking the proper precautions before he's cleared to play. Clippers president of basketball operations, Lawerence Frank, remained coy on Leonard's health and availability heading into the new season. “I think the timing is all going to depend on how his knee responds to each phase,” Frank said, via Anthony De Leon of The Lost Angeles Times. “No one has a crystal ball. We’re trending in a really, really good direction. I know he’s super determined to have a great year, but the timing when it comes to your body and your health, I don’t think you put time frames on it. I think you just have to respond to how he responds.” Leonard can still be a game-changing force. He has all the tools to be a lock-down defender and terrifying scoring threat. But if he removes some of the movement from his game, his three-year $149 million contract will be an incredible overpay. There has to be some middle ground that protects Leonard and allows him to remain healthy while still being an elite talent in the NBA. What that middle ground is remains to be seen. However, right now, his career seems like its in the balance, and with it, the Clippers' chances of bringing success to the Intuit Dome.",

The Dodgers fought back to seal a 7-5 win over their Californian rivals in the opening game of the NLDS Saturday evening. But, while tensions were running high on the field in the playoff thriller, the atmosphere was just as fraught among fans with the edginess coming to a boil. A huge fight reportedly broke out in the stands, according to a fan, Josh Gitt, on social media who claimed the incident occurred in the row in front of him. Two Padres fans allegedly punched a Dodgers supporter and knocked him out, leaving blood splattered across the floor. A vicious brawl reportedly broke out in the stands of Dodger Stadium Saturday night Padres fans allegedly punched a Dodgers fan, leaving blood splattered across the floor The bleeding Dodgers fan reportedly had to be helped out, while the Padres supporters are said to have been ejected. Photos, which were shared to social media by Gitt, who witnessed the incident, showed splotches of blood across one of the seats and the ground, while spilled popcorn lay scattered over the concrete floor. It is currently unclear if any arrests were made. DailyMail.com has contacted the LAPD for comment. The incident is just the latest in a stream of fan violence that has swept through American sports in recent years. The NFL in particular has suffered an epidemic of fan brawls at stadiums across the country over the past couple of seasons. Just last week, horrific scenes played out during the Atlanta Falcons' game against the New Orleans Saints when a man threw another to the ground and repeatedly stomped on his head . The Dodgers fought back to seal a 7-5 win over the Padres in the opening game of the NLDS Meanwhile, the Dodgers and Padres will return to Dodger Stadium Sunday evening - hopefully, this time without incident. The host Dodgers will head into Game 2 of their best-of-five National League Division Series against the San Diego Padres on Sunday night after winning the opener. Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run home run in his first-ever playoff game, and five Dodgers relievers held the Padres scoreless over the final six innings in a 7-5 victory in Game 1 on Saturday. Los Angeles ended a six-game postseason losing streak after it was swept out of last year's NLDS by the Arizona Diamondbacks.

      "content": "Bidding to bounce back from a chastening defeat in the North London derby, Arsenal Under-21s head to Stadium MK to face MK Dons in Tuesday's EFL Trophy showdown. The two teams take up four places in Southern section Group E, where the Gunners beat Leyton Orient 2-1 in their opening tie, while their hosts lost by the same scoreline to Colchester United. © Imago Never before has a Premier League academy team gone all the way to EFL Trophy glory, but Arsenal's quest for silverware began in ideal fashion on September 3, where Mehmet Ali 's men made a true statement of intent by sinking League One Leyton Orient. Strikes from Josh Robinson and Ismeal Kabia either side of a response from Dan Happe ensured that Arsenal would be sitting pretty in first place after one matchday, as the young Gunners endeavour to progress to the second round for the fifth tournament running. That triumph early last month was the fourth of five successive wins for Arsenal's Under-21s, but with former stars Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly now fully-fledged members of the first team, Ali's men have been a shadow of their old selves in the past fortnight. Indeed, an otherwise unblemished September ended with a 3-0 home defeat to Liverpool in the Premier League 2, before Tottenham Hotspur rocked up to Arsenal's territory on Saturday and left with an emphatic 5-2 win under their belts, despite the Gunners being 2-0 ahead at the break. It made a change for Spurs to be on the right end of a 5-2 scoreline against the Gunners - Arsenal's seniors memorably won back-to-back home North London derbies by that exact margin in 2011-12 and 2012-13 - and such a calamitous collapse could set a couple of alarm bells off. © Imago One-time winners of the EFL Trophy back in the 2007-08 campaign - when it was known as the Johnstone's Paint Trophy - MK Dons are already propping up the Southern section Group E rankings on account of a narrow defeat to Colchester three weeks ago. Stephen Wearne drew first blood for the League Two side in the 34th minute, but MK Dons were only ahead for all of seven minutes, as Anthony Scully equalised from the spot before Fiacre Kelleher completed the Colchester turnaround nine minutes into the second half. That 2-1 loss proved to be Mike Williamson 's last game as head coach - the 40-year-old jumped ship for MK Dons' fourth-tier rivals Carlisle United a couple of days later - and after 900-appearance defender Dean Lewington took charge for one game, Scott Lindsey is now overseeing operations. The 52-year-old is yet to suffer defeat since taking the reins, as MK Dons made it four games unbeaten in all competitions with a 1-1 draw against Tranmere Rovers on Saturday, prior to which they ran out 5-1 victors at Harrogate Town. However, that triumph represents the hosts' only win from their last six matches in all competitions, although a four-game unbeaten home run stands them in good stead before a maiden meeting with Arsenal's proteges. © Imago Arsenal goalkeeper Tommy Setford is seemingly still sidelined with an unexplained injury - an issue that allowed 16-year-old Jack Porter to start for the seniors in the EFL Cup against Bolton Wanderers - but the latter is away on international duty this month. A straight shootout will therefore occur between Lucas Nygaard and Brian Okonkwo for the gloves, and Ali will also have 21-year-old striker Khayon Edwards back from a three-game ban. Edwards, Kabia and Romari Forde - who scored at the weekend - could form the attacking trident here, but it remains to be seen if captain Nathan Butler-Oyedeji is involved after making the bench for the first team against Southampton. As for MK Dons, on-loan Southampton defender Nico Lawrence is facing a few more weeks out after a knee operation, while Jonathan Leko has missed most of 2024 after rupturing ligaments in the same area. Striker Matt Dennis is also sidelined, but MK Dons have just added to their attacking ranks with the signing of 32-year-old Ireland international striker Scott Hogan on a free transfer. The former Aston Villa and Birmingham City striker will be eligible to make his Dons debut this week, potentially displacing Tommy Leigh at the tip of the hosts' attack. MK Dons possible starting lineup: Harness; Lewington, Tucker, Offord; Tripp, Kelly, Carroll, Tomlinson; White, Gibley; Hogan Arsenal Under-21s possible starting lineup: Okonkwo; Nichols, Kacurri, Monlouis, Heaven; Gower, Rosiak, Oulad M'Hand; Kabia, Edwards, Forde Arsenal's last two defensive displays have been highly concerning, and an MK Dons side still enjoying a new manager bounce should be able to exploit such frailties. In a reversal of fortunes from the opening matchday, we can picture the League Two outfit prevailing by a 2-1 scoreline on this occasion, as Group E is blown wide open.

      "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine The Brink's Company ( ), by way of a worked example. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Brink's is: 33% = US$146m ÷ US$447m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.33 in profit. By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Brink's has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the . That is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Brink's visit our Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same. It appears that Brink's makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 7.88. While its ROE is no doubt quite impressive, it could give a false impression about the company's returns given that its huge debt could be boosting those returns. Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better. But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE . But note: . So take a peek at this",

      "content": "ICC Women’s World Cup: India secure maiden victory after beating Pakistan in low-scoring match All-round batting and bowling performances help Kaur-led side overcome Green Shirts DUBAI: India delivered an all-round performance against Pakistan to secure their maiden victory in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2024 at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday. Earlier, Indian bowlers excelled with the ball and restricted Pakistan women's team to 105 in the highly-anticipated match. Fatima Sana’s decision to bat first backfired as her side could only accumulate 105/8 in the allotted 20 overs. The Green Shirts had a disastrous start to their innings as they lost opener Gull Feroza in first over of the match. Later, Sidra Amin and Omaima Sohail perished within seven overs with the scoreboard reading 33/3. Following the early debacle, Muneeba Ali offered some fight with her cautious 17-run knock before falling victim to Shreyanka Patil, leaving Pakistan in tatters at 41/4. Meanwhile, all-rounder Aliya Riaz also failed to reach double figures as she fell victim to Arundhati Reddy. Skipper Sana and Nida Dar then tried to settle things down, culminating with the former’s dismissal in the 14th over. Pakistan kept losing wickets at regular intervals, while Dar (28) ticked the scoreboard singlehandedly until finally walking back to the dugout in the last over. Syed Aroob Shah scored a 17-ball fourteen taking the Sana-led team to 105. Reddy bagged three wickets and Patil took two while Renuka Singh and Deepti Sharma and Asha Sobhana struck out one batter apiece. Dar remained the top-scorer for Pakistan with a 34-ball 28. Earlier, the Green Shirts won the toss and decided to bat first against the arch-rivals India. India have to recover quickly after facing defeat against New Zealand in the opening match while the Sana-led side won against the Asia-Cup champions Sir Lanka by 31 runs on Thursday. In regard to this match, Pakistan’s skipper, Sana while talking to ICC, said that she aims to continue the attacking brand of cricket her side has recently adapted against India. \"I have been watching that whichever team we played against — played attacking cricket,\" Sana said ahead of the big contest. Pakistan: Fatima Sana (c), Aliya Riaz, Gull Feroza, Muneeba Ali, Nashra Sundhu, Nida Dar, Omaima Sohail, Sadia Iqbal, Sidra Amin, Syeda Aroob Shah, and Tuba Hassan. India: Harmanpreet Kaur (C), Smriti Mandhana (VC), Shafali Verma, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Richa Ghosh (WK), Arundhati Reddy, Renuka Singh, Asha Sobhana, Shreyanka Patil, and Sajana Sajeevan.

      "description": "McGregor couldn't contain his emotions while watching the champion's post-fight interview....",
      "content": "Following Alex Pereira’s brutal victory against Khalil Rountree Jr . at UFC 307, former two division champion, Conor McGregor , took to social media to share his reaction to the Brazilian's post-fight interview. Heading into the contest, Pereira had been open about his ambitions to compete in any one of three weight classes in the future. Potential bouts at both middleweight and heavyweight were banded about prior to Saturday's pay-per-view event, but Pereira's first focus was to turn back the challenge of Rountree. The 37-year-old is the current light heavyweight champion, and initially faced one of his toughest title defences to date, after being dropped by a counter right-hand in the second round. However, as the fight progressed into the later rounds, 'Poatan' only looked to grow stronger and was eventually too much for the American striker. Towards the end of the fourth round, Rountree Jr, covered in his own blood, was under relentless pressure from Pereira, who continued to dominate. Then, with just 30 seconds remaining, the exhausted challenger finally conceded and collapsed onto the Octagon’s floor, extending the champion's four fight win streak in the world's leading MMA promotion. Alex Pereira's professional MMA record (as of 06/10/2024) 14 Fights 12 wins 2 losses By KO 10 1 By submission 0 1 By decision 2 0 The Brazilian’s UFC record now stands at nine wins against just one loss, with this victory securing him a UFC record for the shortest period between three consecutive title defences. In the aftermath of his success, McGregor had plenty to say on Pereira's future goals. Conor McGregor Screamed at his Television After Alex Pereira's Win at UFC 307 In a now deleted video posted to social media, McGregor posted a video of him watching Pereira’s post-fight interview. Despite initially being full of praise in which the Brazilian took his man out, he quickly become frustrated when Pereira hinted that he may move back down to middleweight and try and reclaim the championship he once held from Dricus du Plessis. As Joe Rogan began to ask about that fight, McGregor shouted at his television. \"Heavyweight, you call for heavyweight now!\" After his past two victories, Pereira has hinted at his ambitions to challenge for a heavyweight title shot and become the UFC’s first three-division champion. Eager to see that come to pass, McGregor was desperate for 'Poatan' to call his shot. However, on this occasion, he insisted he was very happy at light heavyweight and expressed his desire to continue to defend his title. Conor couldn't believe his ears. \"Ah, leave it if he says drop down to middleweight. Don't lie to yourself [about going down to middleweight]. It was a heavy weight cut.\" McGregor grew more agitated with each passing moment, even going as far as to state: \"I'm not watching\" when referring to a potential fight between Pereira and Du Plessis. There might be some logic in Pereira's stance, though. GIVEMESPORT's Key Statistic: Alex Pereira's entire 10-fight UFC career has taken place since Conor McGregor last fought in the Octagon. The heavyweight title is next set to be contested at UFC 309, where Jon Jones will defend against former champion Stipe Miocic. After that fight takes place on the 16th of November, the winner is then obligated to face interim heavyweight champion, Tom Aspinall. Even if he was to have demanded a move to heavyweight, the Brazilian is likely to have to wait at least a year to get a title shot in the division. For a man who has been as active as Pereira, that's a long wait. While a trip up to heavyweight may be in his future, it won't be his next destination. Khalil Rountree's nose wouldn't stop bleeding in a savage post UFC 307 interview with Joe Rogan.",

Instead, the British billionaire, who bought a in the 20-time English champion in February, said the decision over Ten Hag’s future rested in the hands of the executive he has put in place to run the club.

      "description": "SportsLine's advanced computer model just locked in its top Week 5 NFL survivor picks",
      "content": "Anyone making Week 5 NFL survivor pool picks will now have to navigate bye weeks. In Week 5, you'll have four fewer teams to choose from for NFL survivor picks, including Super Bowl contenders like the Lions and Eagles, as well as an easy team to pick on, the 1-3 Titans. Did you use up all of the big dogs early on, or were you strategic with your early NFL knockout pool picks, leaving quality options for your Week 5 NFL eliminator pool picks? The Ravens looked like a juggernaut while demolishing the Bills last Sunday, but they now have a tough road matchup versus a Bengals team coming off their first win and are favored by less than a field goal. The Bills are one-point underdogs in the latest NFL odds Week 5 after being one-point favorites earlier this week. The Jaguars (-3.5) are the lone winless team in action, but their opponent, the Colts , could be without starting quarterback Anthony Richardson (oblique, abdominal), who departed last Sunday's game, and star running back Jonathan Taylor (out, ankle), who will be replaced by Trey Sermon. Before finalizing any Week 5 NFL survivor picks, see which team the red-hot SportsLine Projection Model just went all-in on . The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 5 of the 2024 NFL season on an incredible 188-131 run on top-rated NFL picks that dates back to the 2017 season. It is also on a 42-23 roll on top-rated NFL picks since Week 7 of 2022. The model also ranked in the top 10 on NFLPickWatch four of the past six years on straight-up NFL picks and beat more than 94 percent of CBS Sports Football Pick'em players four times during that span. Anyone who has followed it is way up. The model can be used to crush the Survivor Pool format, which calls for picking one team to win each week but never using the same team twice. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 5 NFL odds and locked in its Week 5 survivor pool pick. You can only see who the model is backing this week at SportsLine . In Week 5 of the 2024 NFL season, the model is shying away from the Chiefs (-5.5, 43) versus New Orleans on Monday Night Football, even though Kansas City is undefeated. The Chiefs won last week versus the Chargers , but they lost leading receiver Rashee Rice to a knee injury, to add to the absences of running back Isiah Pacheco and receiver Marquise Brown . That may be putting too much pressure on Patrick Mahomes ' right arm, and it's becoming apparent. Mahomes, who has the second-highest passer rating in NFL history (103), has seen his passer rating drop below 90 in his last three games, making it the first time in five years that's occurred. The Chiefs have also seen their points total drop in every game this season, while the Saints (2-2) just suffered a somewhat fluky loss to the Falcons in which New Orleans didn't allow an offensive touchdown. New Orleans still owns the league's top scoring offense, and its No. 7 scoring defense makes the Saints just one of two teams to rank in the top eight on both sides of the ball. While the Chiefs are projected to win in over 60% of simulations, the model is saving Kansas City for another week. See which team to pick instead here . Instead, the model is backing a surprising team that wins outright in well over 70% of simulations and has a 6-0 streak on its side. The time to pick this team is now, and you can only see the play over at SportsLine . Which surprising team is a must-back in your Week 5 NFL survivor pool? Visit SportsLine now to see which team carries you to victory in Week 5, all from the advanced computer model that is up well over $7,000 since its inception .",

The league will play five games away from the US in 2024, with one already being played in Brazil while the first of three London games will kick off on Sunday.

      "content": "We recently compiled a list of the . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:SMMT) stands against the other great performing NASDAQ stocks. Fed's recent cut has resulted in significant outperformance in the tech sector, signaling a positive sentiment among investors. Tech stocks are thriving in this lower interest rate environment, which has contributed to a broader market rally. The strength of small-cap stocks and cyclical sectors was noticeable even before the reduction, suggesting that market confidence was building. Analysts expect ongoing growth driven by advancements in AI, which continues to be a key theme influencing investor behavior. The occurrence of rate cuts while markets are at record highs raises important questions about potential volatility. Historically, markets have shown resilience and often continue to rise even when rate cuts occur near market peaks. This suggests that much of the current optimism may already be reflected in stock prices. The recent rate cut is generally viewed as a preventive measure rather than a direct response to economic weakness, which could further enhance consumer confidence and spending. Towards the end of September, RaeAnn Mitrione, Investment Management Partner at Callan Family Office, appeared in an interview and highlighted significant market developments following the Fed’s unexpectedly larger-than-anticipated rate cut. We covered this in detail in our article on the , here's a short excerpt from it: “...Mitrione emphasized that the market is reacting favorably to lower interest rates, particularly benefiting the tech sector... Pointing at a chart, Mitrione remarked that it is unusual to see rate cuts while markets are at record highs, raising questions about potential volatility ahead. Historically, even when rate cuts occur near market peaks, stocks often continue to rise. Much of this positive sentiment has been priced in due to prior indications of the rate cut. She explained that the economy remains strong, and the rate cut serves as a preventive measure rather than a reaction to economic weakness. This supportive environment could enhance consumer confidence and spending, further improving market performance.” On September 28, DataTrek Research co-founder, Nick Colas, joined an interview on CNBC to discuss the trading day and highlight that the tech rally will have to wait until year-end. As September ended, the S&P 500 saw a remarkable increase of 20% year-to-date. In light of this performance, market participants began revisiting the post-Fed rate cut playbook following the initial easing. Nick Colas noted that one of the most encouraging aspects of September is that the market has not experienced a decline, which is typically expected during this month known for its volatility. Instead, the S&P had risen by 1.6% so far in September, demonstrating resilience despite some initial choppiness, which is particularly noteworthy given September's historical reputation for turbulence. As Colas noted, on the macroeconomic front, positive indicators are emerging. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model has revised its Q3 growth estimate upward to 3.1%, signaling that the economy is performing well. Additionally, gasoline demand has increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting strong consumer activity. Initial jobless claims reported recently also show a solid performance, falling below the three-year average. These data points support the mid-cycle playbook employed by DataTrek, suggesting that the economy is continuing to progress without any significant cracks or fissures in its foundation. Despite these positive trends, questions remain about whether the market can sustain its momentum without new positive catalysts. Colas pointed out that historically, price-to-earnings multiples and stock prices tend to rise together as long as there are no major negative catalysts to disrupt the economic recovery. This correlation indicates that investor confidence remains intact and is likely to persist through the remainder of the year. Furthermore, as the market approaches traditionally strong months following elections, there are expectations for a potential old Santa Claus rally in December. However, with the volatility index elevated at around 17 and geopolitical tensions looming, especially as elections approach, investors are likely to remain cautious. Over the past two years, the NASDAQ 100 has surged approximately 67%, marking a significant recovery since its lows in October two years ago. This performance is substantially above the historical average return of around 25%. Colas emphasized that while such returns are impressive, they do not yet indicate speculative excess; historically, a doubling of the NASDAQ over two years would signal potential trouble for investors. Looking back further, Colas noted that since peaking before the bear market in November 2021, the NASDAQ 100 has only risen about 20% over three years. This suggests that there may still be room for growth compared to prior bubbles when returns were much more pronounced within shorter time frames. The ongoing rotation away from technology stocks has been observed recently, with cyclical sectors and financials performing well. Colas believes this trend may continue for now, with a potential resurgence in tech stocks expected closer to November and December as year-end approaches. Investors appear to be favoring cyclical sectors at present, which offer more immediate upside opportunities. While there are challenges ahead, the current economic indicators suggest a robust environment for continued growth in equities as long as investor confidence remains high and no major negative catalysts emerge to derail progress. Despite a recent rotation away from tech stocks, the market remains resilient, with the potential for a tech resurgence as we approach year-end, setting the stage for a bullish outlook for both tech and the NASDAQ in the coming months. When optimism about economic conditions or technological advancements rises, tech stocks typically perform well, boosting the NASDAQ. We used stock screeners to look for companies listed on NASDAQ that were trading over $10 billion. We then selected the top 10 NASDAQ stocks with the best year-to-date performance and that were also the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their year-to-date performance. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:SMMT) is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of patient, physician, caregiver, and societal-friendly medicinal therapies in the US, and the UK. Over the past few months, the company has made significant progress in raising awareness of ivonescimab and its mission to develop innovative treatments for serious oncology needs. Its partnership with Akeso, a well-established Chinese biotech, has been instrumental in advancing ivonescimab’s development and significantly reducing development risks. Together, they conducted two successful Phase 3 clinical trials, HARMONi-A and HARMONi-2, for ivonescimab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yielding positive data that provide strong evidence for the drug’s potential. It also announced a 5-year strategic collaboration with MD Anderson to accelerate ivonescimab’s development, complementing its ongoing collaboration with Akeso. Currently, there are 20 ongoing clinical trials evaluating ivonescimab for various cancer types. While the current Phase 3 programs focus on NSCLC, seven trials are exploring its potential in other solid tumors. Early-stage clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of ivonescimab in treating NSCLC. Its strong financial position allows it to allocate resources for ongoing development efforts, supported by a solid cash balance. In Q2 2024, R&D expenses remained stable, although acquired IP R&D expenses increased due to a licensing agreement amendment. Overall operating expenses remained consistent. Summit Therapeutics Inc.
